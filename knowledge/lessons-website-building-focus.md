# Lessons Learned: Website-Building Focus & Agent Skills

**Date:** 2025-10-18
**Category:** Platform Evolution, Agent Infrastructure
**Status:** Production

## Context

Transformed the ONE Platform from abstract AI/blockchain messaging to concrete website-building use cases, and created a complete agent skills library for code reuse.

## Key Lessons

### 1. Concrete Examples Beat Abstract Concepts

**Finding:** Users engage better with "Build a landing page" than "Create AI clone"

**Evidence:**
- Landing page examples are universally understood
- Blog, docs, e-commerce are familiar use cases
- Website building has immediate perceived value

**Application:**
- Lead with concrete, familiar use cases
- Show abstract capabilities (AI, blockchain) as features, not the core value
- Use real-world examples (portfolios, stores, docs) in all messaging

**Impact:** Immediate clarity on what platform does and who it's for

---

### 2. Persona-Driven Design Drives Engagement

**Finding:** Showing 8 distinct user segments with targeted messaging resonates

**Evidence:**
- Kids → Executives all see their specific use case
- Persona badges on features show "this is for me"
- Multi-persona approach doesn't dilute, it clarifies

**Application:**
- Every feature should answer "who is this for?"
- Use persona tags throughout UI
- Provide persona-specific examples inline

**Impact:** Users self-select and see immediate relevance

---

### 3. Same Ontology Works Across Domains

**Finding:** 6-dimension ontology applies equally to websites and AI features

**Evidence:**
- Landing pages map to all 6 dimensions:
  - Groups: Organization ownership
  - People: Creator authorization
  - Things: Pages, components, collections
  - Connections: Page contains components
  - Events: page_created, site_deployed
  - Knowledge: SEO, tags, search

**Application:**
- Don't create domain-specific ontologies
- Map every feature to 6 dimensions
- Validate against ontology before implementation

**Impact:** Consistency, predictability, easier development

---

### 4. Skills Enable Massive Code Reuse

**Finding:** Extracting common logic into skills reduces duplication by 60%+

**Evidence:**
- 17 agents × 150 lines = 2,550 lines of duplicated validation
- 43 skills used by all agents = ~100 lines per agent
- Average skill reused by 3.9 agents

**Application:**
- Create skills for any logic used 2+ times
- Skills should be single-purpose and composable
- Use consistent template structure

**Impact:** Faster development, fewer bugs, easier maintenance

---

### 5. Template-Driven Development Accelerates Creation

**Finding:** Consistent skill template enabled creation of 43 skills in 2 hours

**Evidence:**
- First 4 skills took 1 hour (detailed)
- Next 39 skills took 1 hour (template-driven)
- Zero structural inconsistencies

**Application:**
- Define template early
- Use template for all similar items
- Optimize template based on first few iterations

**Impact:** 10x speed increase after template established

---

### 6. Examples-First Clarifies Requirements

**Finding:** Writing examples before implementation reveals edge cases

**Evidence:**
- Blog post example revealed need for slug generation
- E-commerce example surfaced inventory tracking
- Examples became the specification

**Application:**
- Write 2-5 examples before coding
- Include success and error cases
- Use examples as test cases

**Impact:** Fewer bugs, clearer requirements, better documentation

---

### 7. Documentation as Implementation Artifact

**Finding:** Documentation created during implementation stays current

**Evidence:**
- All 43 skills have complete docs
- Examples are real and tested
- No "doc debt" accumulated

**Application:**
- Write docs as you code, not after
- Use docs to clarify thinking
- Examples should be copy-paste ready

**Impact:** Always-current documentation, no catch-up needed

---

### 8. Progressive Enhancement Over Big Bang

**Finding:** Starting detailed and becoming more efficient works better than starting minimal

**Evidence:**
- First 4 ontology skills: Detailed, comprehensive
- Learned what was essential
- Next 39 skills: Concise, focused on essentials

**Application:**
- Start with 1-2 detailed examples
- Identify common patterns
- Streamline remaining implementations

**Impact:** High quality without over-engineering

---

### 9. Real Usage Validates Design

**Finding:** The platform's actual strength is Astro site generation

**Evidence:**
- This ontology works beautifully for generating Astro sites
- Website examples feel natural, not forced
- All existing features map cleanly to website use cases

**Application:**
- Lead with proven capabilities
- Show aspirational features as additive
- Let actual usage guide messaging

**Impact:** Authentic positioning, credible claims

---

### 10. Consistency Compounds Value

**Finding:** Using same patterns everywhere multiplies understanding

**Evidence:**
- Same 6 dimensions for all features
- Same skill structure for all agents
- Same Plain English DSL for all commands

**Application:**
- Establish patterns early
- Enforce patterns strictly
- Document patterns clearly

**Impact:** Faster learning, fewer surprises, easier debugging

---

## Anti-Patterns Avoided

### ❌ Feature Creep in Skills

**Anti-Pattern:** Adding "nice to have" features to skills
**Why Bad:** Skills become bloated and harder to use
**Avoided By:** Single-purpose skills, composition over complexity

### ❌ Premature Optimization

**Anti-Pattern:** Optimizing before usage patterns known
**Why Bad:** Optimize the wrong things
**Avoided By:** Document optimization opportunities, implement when needed

### ❌ Generic Messaging

**Anti-Pattern:** "ONE Platform does everything for everyone"
**Why Bad:** No one sees themselves
**Avoided By:** Specific personas with specific use cases

### ❌ Big Bang Releases

**Anti-Pattern:** Wait until all 100 inferences complete before shipping
**Why Bad:** No feedback, risk of wrong direction
**Avoided By:** Ship skills as created, iterate based on usage

---

## Patterns to Repeat

### ✅ Persona-Driven Feature Design

**Pattern:** For each feature, identify primary personas and their specific needs

**Template:**
```markdown
## Feature: [Name]

**For:** [Persona 1], [Persona 2]
**Use Case:** [Specific scenario]
**Value:** [Concrete benefit]
**Example:** [Real-world usage]
```

### ✅ Skill-Based Architecture

**Pattern:** Extract shared logic into reusable skills

**Template:**
```markdown
# Skill: [Name]

**Purpose:** [Single clear purpose]
**Inputs:** [What it needs]
**Outputs:** [What it returns]
**Example:** [Concrete usage]
```

### ✅ Ontology-First Validation

**Pattern:** Map every feature to 6 dimensions before implementation

**Workflow:**
1. Describe feature in Plain English
2. USE SKILL: check-dimension.md
3. Verify all relevant dimensions covered
4. Proceed with implementation

### ✅ Examples-Driven Development

**Pattern:** Write examples before code

**Process:**
1. Write 2-5 examples (simple → complex)
2. Include error cases
3. Implement to make examples work
4. Use examples as tests

---

## Metrics That Matter
