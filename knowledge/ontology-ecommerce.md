##  E-commerce Ontology Specification

Version: 1.0.0 (Intelligent Commerce Engine)

Status: Complete & Generic

Design Principle: This ontology models any e-commerce business in six dimensions, transforming a simple online store into a proactive, intelligent commerce engine. It is the single source of truth for all business operations, from inventory management to AI-driven marketing.

### The Philosophy: Your Store is an Engine, Not a Shelf

A traditional e-commerce site is a digital shelf—a passive display of products. An intelligent commerce engine is a sentient system that understands its products, knows its customers, anticipates market trends, and automates its own growth.

This ontology provides the universal structure for that engine. Every command, feature, and piece of data is mapped to these six fundamental dimensions.

## 1. GROUP: The Business Entity

This is the top-level container that defines your entire store as a single, cohesive unit.

### Group Structure

TypeScript

```
{
  _id: Id<'groups'>,
  slug: 'your-store-name', // e.g., 'acme-widgets'
  name: 'Your Store Name',
  type: 'business',
  metadata: {
    domain: 'yourstore.com',
    defaultCurrency: 'USD',
    defaultCountry: 'USA'
  },
  status: 'active'
}
```

## 2. PEOPLE: The Actors

This dimension defines every person who interacts with your store and their specific role.

### Person Roles

1. **`group_owner`**: The business owner with full administrative privileges. Maps to store owner/admin.

2. **`group_user`**: Employees with specific permissions (e.g., order fulfillment, customer support). Maps to staff members.

3. **`customer`**: Any individual who browses or buys from the store, from anonymous visitor to loyal patron.


### Person Structure

TypeScript

```
{
  _id: Id<'people'>,
  email: string,
  role: 'platform_owner' | 'group_owner' | 'group_user' | 'customer',
  displayName?: string,
  defaultShippingAddress?: { /* ... */ },
  createdAt: number
}
```
