# Altcoin Cycle Trading Strategy

**Actionable Implementation Guide for Capital Rotation Trading**

## Executive Summary

This strategy operationalizes the Altcoin Cycle Prediction Ontology into specific trading rules, position sizing, entry/exit signals, and risk management protocols. Based on the proven pattern of capital flowing from M2 → BTC → ETH → Alts → Risk-off, we can systematically capture gains across each rotation phase.

**Current Cycle Position** (November 2025): Mid-bull, BTC at $106k, approaching ETH rotation phase.

---

## Strategy Overview

### Core Principles

1. **Follow the Flow**: Money moves predictably through asset tiers
2. **Respect the Cycle**: Each phase has optimal positioning
3. **Manage Risk Ruthlessly**: Preservation > Speculation
4. **Time Rotations**: Catch the wave as capital moves
5. **Take Profits**: Nobody went broke taking profits

### Strategy Performance Targets

| Phase | Target Return | Timeframe | Risk Level |
|-------|--------------|-----------|------------|
| BTC Accumulation | 2-3x | 12-18 months | Low |
| ETH Rotation | 3-5x | 6-12 months | Medium |
| Alt Season | 5-20x | 3-6 months | High |
| Memecoin Mania | 10-100x | 1-3 months | Extreme |
| Bear Market | Preserve Capital | 12-24 months | Defensive |

---

## Phase-Specific Strategies

### Phase 1: BTC Accumulation (Complete for this cycle)

**Indicators**:
- M2 bottoming or starting to expand ✓
- BTC below 200-week MA
- Extreme fear (F&G < 20)
- "Crypto is dead" headlines

**Strategy**: Missed this phase? Wait for ETH rotation.

---

### Phase 2: BTC Breakout (Current - Mature Stage)

**Entry Signals**:
- BTC breaks previous cycle high ($69k) ✓
- Sustained above 200-day MA ✓
- Institutional announcements increasing ✓

**Current Action Items**:
```
IF you have BTC:
  - Trail stop at $85k (20% below current)
  - Take 25% profits above $120k
  - Hold core position for $150k+

IF you don't have BTC:
  - Wait for ETH rotation (better risk/reward)
  - Or DCA small amounts on any dips to $95-100k
  - Avoid FOMO buying above $110k
```

**Exit Signals**:
- BTC dominance > 65% = prepare to rotate
- M2 growth decelerating
- Fed turning hawkish

---

### Phase 3: ETH Rotation (Imminent - Best Opportunity)

**Entry Signals** (WATCHING NOW):
```
✅ BTC dominance topping around 58-60%
✅ ETH/BTC making higher lows (currently at 0.034)
⏳ ETH breaks $4,000 convincingly
⏳ DeFi TVL expanding
⏳ Layer 2 activity increasing
```

**ETH Rotation Trade Setup**:
```python
ENTRY STRATEGY:
if btc_dominance > 57% and eth_btc < 0.04:
    # Begin rotating BTC to ETH
    week_1: Swap 20% of BTC to ETH
    week_2: Swap another 20% if ETH/BTC rising
    week_3: Swap another 20% if momentum continues

    Target Allocation:
    - BTC: 20% (down from 40%)
    - ETH: 40% (up from 20%)

POSITION SIZING:
- Entry 1: ETH at $3,800-4,000 (25% of allocation)
- Entry 2: ETH at $4,200-4,400 (25% of allocation)
- Entry 3: ETH on any dip below $4,000 (25% of allocation)
- Entry 4: ETH breakout above $5,000 (25% of allocation)

TARGETS:
- Target 1: $6,000 (sell 20%)
- Target 2: $8,000 (sell 20%)
- Target 3: $10,000 (sell 20%)
- Target 4: $12,000+ (sell 20%)
- Moonbag: Hold 20% for $15,000+

STOP LOSS:
- Hard stop: ETH/BTC breaks below 0.03
- Trailing stop: 25% below local high
```

### Phase 4: Alt Season (Next 2-4 months)

**Trigger Conditions**:
```
□ ETH makes new ATH above $4,800
□ BTC dominance falls below 50%
□ Total Alt Market Cap breaks $2T
□ Social media alt coin fever returns
□ "Alt Season Index" > 75
```

**Alt Selection Framework**:

```typescript
// Tier 1: Blue Chip Alts (40% of alt allocation)
const tier1_alts = [
  "SOL",  // Solana - ETH competitor
  "AVAX", // Avalanche - DeFi ecosystem
  "MATIC", // Polygon - Scaling solution
  "LINK", // Chainlink - Oracle king
  "UNI"   // Uniswap - DEX leader
];

// Tier 2: Narrative Leaders (30% of alt allocation)
const tier2_alts = [
  "AI Tokens", // FET, AGIX, OCEAN, etc (X402 ecosystem)
  "Gaming",    // IMX, GALA, AXS
  "L2s",       // ARB, OP, ZK
  "DeFi 2.0",  // AAVE, CRV, MKR
];

// Tier 3: High Risk/Reward (20% of alt allocation)
const tier3_alts = [
  "New L1s",      // APT, SUI, SEI
  "AI Agents",    // Individual agent tokens
  "Real World Assets", // RWA tokens
  "Interoperability"  // DOT, ATOM, QNT
];

// Tier 4: Degen Plays (10% of alt allocation)
const tier4_alts = [
  "Memecoins",    // DOGE, SHIB, PEPE (only established ones)
  "X402 micro",   // New x402 payment tokens
  "AI memes",     // AI-themed memecoins
];
```

**Alt Season Execution**:

```python
ALT SEASON ENTRY RULES:
1. Wait for ETH to establish new ATH
2. Begin with Tier 1 alts (safest)
3. Gradually add Tier 2 as momentum builds
4. Tier 3 only after 50%+ gains on Tier 1
5. Tier 4 = gambling money only

POSITION MANAGEMENT:
- Never more than 5% in any single alt
- Take 30% profits at 2x
- Take 30% profits at 5x
- Take 30% profits at 10x
- Let 10% ride as moonbag

ROTATION RULES:
if alt_gains > 5x and newer_narrative_emerging:
    Rotate 50% to new narrative
if alt_showing_weakness and others_strong:
    Cut losses at -30% and rotate
```

---

### Phase 5: Memecoin Mania (TOP SIGNAL)

**Warning Indicators**:
```
🚨 Dogecoin in Top 5 market cap
🚨 Random memecoins doing 100x daily
🚨 TikTok crypto influencers everywhere
🚨 Taxi drivers giving crypto tips
🚨 "This time is different" narrative
🚨 Your grandma asks about crypto
```

**EXIT STRATEGY - THE MOST IMPORTANT PART**:

```python
WHEN MEMECOIN MANIA DETECTED:

Week 1:
- Sell 50% of all alts immediately
- Convert to stablecoins (USDC, USDT)
- Move BTC/ETH stops to break-even

Week 2:
- Sell another 25% of alts
- Reduce ETH by 50%
- Keep only BTC core position

Week 3:
- Final alt liquidation
- BTC/ETH only 20% of portfolio
- 80% in stablecoins

NEVER:
- Try to time the exact top
- Get greedy for last 10%
- Buy back in immediately
- Ignore the exit signals
```

---

## Risk Management Framework

### Position Sizing Rules

```python
def calculate_position_size(risk_score, portfolio_value, asset_tier):
    """
    Kelly Criterion Modified for Crypto
    """
    base_allocation = {
        'BTC': 0.40,      # 40% max
        'ETH': 0.30,      # 30% max
        'Large_Alt': 0.05, # 5% max per position
        'Mid_Alt': 0.03,   # 3% max per position
        'Small_Alt': 0.01, # 1% max per position
        'Memecoin': 0.005  # 0.5% max (gambling only)
    }

    # Adjust for cycle phase
    cycle_multiplier = get_cycle_multiplier() # 0.5 (bear) to 1.5 (bull)

    # Adjust for risk score
    risk_adjustment = (100 - risk_score) / 100

    final_size = portfolio_value * base_allocation[asset_tier] * cycle_multiplier * risk_adjustment

    return final_size
```

### Stop Loss Strategy

**Graduated Stop Losses**:
```
BTC:
- Initial: -15% (wide due to volatility)
- After +50% gain: Move to break-even
- After +100% gain: Trail at -20%

ETH:
- Initial: -20%
- After +50% gain: Move to break-even
- After +100% gain: Trail at -25%

Large Cap Alts:
- Initial: -25%
- After +50% gain: Move to break-even
- After +100% gain: Trail at -30%

Small Cap Alts:
- Initial: -30%
- After +100% gain: Move to break-even
- After +200% gain: Trail at -40%

Memecoins:
- No stop loss (assume 100% loss potential)
- Take profits aggressively on pumps
```

### Portfolio Rebalancing

**Weekly Rebalancing Rules**:
```python
Every Sunday:
1. Calculate current allocations
2. Compare to target allocations
3. If any position > 10% off target:
   - Rebalance back to target
4. If cycle phase changed:
   - Adjust targets per new phase
5. If new narrative emerging:
   - Allocate 5% to research positions
```

2. **Not taking profits on the way up**
3. **Over-leveraging in late cycle**
4. **Ignoring macro liquidity conditions**
5. **Falling in love with your bags**

### Psychological Traps

```
Bear Market: "Crypto is dead forever"
Reality: Best accumulation opportunity

Early Bull: "It's going back down"
Reality: Trend is your friend

Mid Bull: "I missed it, too late"
Reality: Still 50% of gains ahead

Late Bull: "Going to $1M this cycle"
Reality: Time to take profits

Top: "This time is different"
Reality: It never is
```

## Advanced Strategies

### Layer 2 Rotation Play

As ETH gas fees rise in alt season:
```
1. Accumulate L2 tokens (ARB, OP, MATIC)
2. Position before "L2 Summer" narrative
3. Ride the scaling solution wave
4. Exit when L2 TVL plateaus
```

### AI Agent Economy Play (2025 Special)

With X402 protocol enabling agent payments:
```
1. Identify top performing AI agents
2. Buy tokens of profitable agents
3. Focus on agents with real revenue
4. Avoid agents without utility
5. Exit when agent mania peaks
```

### Stablecoin Yield Farming (Bear Market)

When cycle tops:
```
1. Convert to stablecoins
2. Farm 10-20% APY on AAVE/Compound
3. Wait for next cycle bottom
4. Maintain purchasing power
5. Re-enter at accumulation phase
```
