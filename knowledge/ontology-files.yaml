notes:
  - "This file is the master reference for understanding the entire ONE Platform"
  - "Every feature maps to one or more files in this ontology"
  - "The 6-dimension ontology (things, connections, events, knowledge, people, groups) is implemented in backend/convex/schema.ts"
  - "Installation customization happens via one-inc/ folder - overrides global defaults"
  - "All AI agents should read this file to understand the system structure"
  - "Use 'Quick Reference Paths' section to navigate quickly"
  - "File relationships show dependencies - useful for impact analysis"
  - "Metrics show current state - used for planning capacity"
  - "Deployment targets show where code actually runs"
