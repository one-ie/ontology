### The Core: A Minimal E-Commerce System

At its heart, any online store can be described with this simple structure:

1. **Group:** The store itself (`Nine Padel Store`).
    
2. **People:** The `store_owner` and the `customer`.
    
3. **Things:** The `product` being sold and the `order` to purchase it.
    
4. **Connections:** The customer `places` an order. The order `contains` a product.
    
5. **Events:** A `product_viewed` event, leading to an `order_placed` event.
    
6. **Knowledge:** The `order_status` (e.g., `pending`, `shipped`).
    

This minimal model provides the foundation. Now, we'll expand it with the specific details from ninepadel.com to create a complete and tailored ontology.
