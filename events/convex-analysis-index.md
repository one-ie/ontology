## The 6 Dimensions - At a Glance

```
DIMENSION 1: GROUPS           [24 functions]  ✓ Perfect
DIMENSION 2: PEOPLE           [ 9 functions]  ✓ Perfect
DIMENSION 3: THINGS (entities)[19 functions]  ✓ Aligned
DIMENSION 4: CONNECTIONS      [14+ functions] ✓ Perfect
DIMENSION 5: EVENTS           [17 functions]  ✓ Perfect
DIMENSION 6: KNOWLEDGE        [20+ functions] ✓ Perfect
────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TOTAL:                        [134+ functions]
```

Each dimension has:
- **mutations/** - Create, update, delete operations
- **queries/** - Read operations with indexes
- **actions/** - Async/external operations
- **schema.ts** - Database table definition

## File Organization

### By Dimension

**Dimension 1: Groups** (Hierarchical Containers)
```
mutations/groups.ts        → create, update, archive, restore
queries/groups.ts          → getBySlug, list, hierarchy, search (14 functions)
actions/groups.ts          → sendInvitation, export, sync
```

**Dimension 2: People** (Authorization & Governance)
```
mutations/people.ts        → create, updateRole, updateProfile, addToGroups
queries/people.ts          → getByEmail, getByUserId, list, getMemberships
```

**Dimension 3: Things** (All Nouns)
```
mutations/entities.ts      → create, update, archive, restore
queries/entities.ts        → list, getById, search, getActivity, counts
actions/entities.ts        → embeddings, process, analyze, export
```

**Dimension 4: Connections** (Relationships)
```
mutations/connections.ts   → create, update, delete
queries/connections.ts     → listFrom, listTo, listBetween, listByType
actions/connections.ts     → analyzeStrength, payment, recommend
```

**Dimension 5: Events** (Audit Trail)
```
queries/events.ts          → list, byActor, byTarget, stats
internalActions/events.ts  → logEntityCreated, logConnectionCreated
```

**Dimension 6: Knowledge** (RAG, Embeddings)
```
mutations/knowledge.ts     → create, update, linkToEntity
queries/knowledge.ts       → list, search, byLabel, stats
actions/knowledge.ts       → embeddings, chunk, semanticSearch
```

### By Type

**Mutations** (Write Operations)
- 8 files, 28 functions
- Pattern: authenticate → validate → create → log

**Queries** (Read Operations)
- 10 files, 54 functions
- Pattern: use index → filter → return

**Actions** (Async Operations)
- 4 files, 26 functions
- Pattern: call external service, return result

**Internal Actions** (System Operations)
- 3 files, 26 functions
- Pattern: logging, search, validation

---

## Recommendations Summary

### CRITICAL (Do These)
**None** - Your structure is excellent

### RECOMMENDED (5 minutes)
**Rename internalActions/eventLogger.ts → internalActions/events.ts**
- Improves naming consistency
- Matches query/mutation pattern
- Safe refactoring, zero risk

### OPTIONAL (15-50 minutes total)
1. Consolidate setup files (init + onboarding)
2. Rename entities → things (100% ontology purity)
3. Create services/onboarding/ subfolder

---

## What's Working Perfectly

1. **Multi-Tenant Isolation**
   - Every operation scoped by groupId
   - Enforced at schema and function level

2. **Audit Trail**
   - Every mutation logs an event
   - 67+ event types defined
   - Complete history tracking

3. **Consistent Patterns**
   - All mutations: authenticate → validate → create → log
   - All queries: use index → filter → return
   - Makes code predictable

4. **Type Safety**
   - No `any` except in flexible `properties`
   - Compile-time error detection

5. **Flexible Ontology**
   - 66+ entity types (base + features)
   - 30+ connection types
   - Dynamic composition from YAML

## Common Questions

**Q: Where do I add a new operation?**
A: Pick the dimension (1-6), create mutations/queries/actions files if needed

**Q: How do I create a mutation?**
A: Follow the 6-step pattern: authenticate → validate → get actor → create → log → return

**Q: How do I create a query?**
A: Use proper index, filter by groupId first, apply additional filters, return

**Q: Where do external integrations go?**
A: actions/dimension-name.ts (generateEmbeddings, sendEmail, etc.)

**Q: How is multi-tenant isolation enforced?**
A: Every record has groupId, every query filters by it, database enforces it

**Q: What if I need to log a custom event?**
A: Insert into events table with groupId, type, actorId, targetId, metadata

---

## Performance Notes

1. **Always use indexes** - Don't iterate all records
2. **Filter by groupId first** - Security + speed
3. **Use combined indexes** - group_type is faster than group + type
4. **Batch operations** - When creating many records
5. **Cache results** - Queries can be expensive at scale

---

## Next Steps

1. **For Understanding:** Read CONVEX-QUICK-REFERENCE.md
2. **For Complete Analysis:** Read CONVEX-STRUCTURE-ANALYSIS.md
3. **For Visuals:** Look at CONVEX-STRUCTURE-DIAGRAM.txt
4. **For Implementation:** Review mutations/groups.ts
5. **For Discussion:** Consider the RECOMMENDED rename

---

## The Big Picture

Your backend implements a **universal 6-dimension ontology** that:
- Scales from friend circles (2 people) to governments (billions)
- Enforces multi-tenant isolation at every level
- Logs every action for compliance
- Uses consistent patterns for predictability
- Supports flexible, composable entity types
- Has complete type safety

This is **production-ready, exemplary work**.

The only path to 100% compliance is optional naming refinements (5-50 minutes).
