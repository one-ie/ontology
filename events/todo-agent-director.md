# Agent Director TODO List - Write e2e tests for critical paths (Cycle 65)

## Director Responsibilities

The Agent Director orchestrates the entire workflow, ensuring all specialists complete their tasks in the correct sequence with proper dependencies.

### Phase 1: Planning & Orchestration (Current)

**Task 1.1: Create Agent Director TODO** ✅ IN_PROGRESS
- [ ] List all director responsibilities
- [ ] Identify key decision points
- [ ] Plan orchestration sequence
- [ ] Document dependencies between agents

**Task 1.2: Analyze Current Cycle State**
- [ ] Current: Cycle 65 - Write e2e tests for critical paths
- [ ] Progress: 64/100 complete (64%)
- [ ] Specialist: quality
- [ ] Task: Test critical user workflows

**Task 1.3: Identify Required Agents & Specializations**
- [ ] agent-quality: E2E test writing, test orchestration
- [ ] agent-frontend: Component testing, integration testing
- [ ] agent-builder: Service/mutation testing, backend validation
- [ ] agent-problem-solver: Test failure analysis, debugging
- [ ] agent-documenter: Test documentation, lessons learned

**Task 1.4: Create Agent Dependency Map**
- [ ] Quality agent writes e2e test specifications
- [ ] Frontend agent creates component/integration tests
- [ ] Builder agent creates service layer tests
- [ ] Problem solver analyzes test failures
- [ ] Documenter captures lessons learned

**Task 1.5: Launch Parallel Agent TODO Creation** 🎯 NEXT
- [ ] Spin up agent-quality with todo-agent-quality.md scope
- [ ] Spin up agent-frontend with todo-agent-frontend.md scope
- [ ] Spin up agent-builder with todo-agent-builder.md scope
- [ ] Spin up agent-problem-solver with todo-agent-problem-solver.md scope
- [ ] Spin up agent-documenter with todo-agent-documenter.md scope
- [ ] Monitor agent progress and dependencies
- [ ] Aggregate results into master timeline

### Phase 2: Validation & Quality Gates

**Task 2.1: Validate Test Coverage**
- [ ] Confirm all critical paths covered
- [ ] Verify test case count meets goals
- [ ] Check assertion quality
- [ ] Validate test data fixtures

**Task 2.2: Coordinate Test Execution**
- [ ] Unit tests (agent-builder, agent-quality)
- [ ] Integration tests (agent-frontend, agent-builder)
- [ ] E2E tests (agent-quality, agent-frontend)
- [ ] Performance tests (agent-quality)

**Task 2.3: Manage Test Failures**
- [ ] Collect failures from all agents
- [ ] Route to agent-problem-solver
- [ ] Track resolution progress
- [ ] Document root causes

**Task 2.4: Ensure Ontology Compliance**
- [ ] Verify all 6 dimensions covered
- [ ] Check schema alignment
- [ ] Validate error handling patterns
- [ ] Confirm audit logging

### Phase 3: Advancement & Documentation

**Task 3.1: Aggregate Agent Results**
- [ ] Collect todos from all agents
- [ ] Merge parallel work streams
- [ ] Create unified timeline
- [ ] Document interdependencies

**Task 3.2: Mark Cycle Complete**
- [ ] All tests written and passing
- [ ] All validations complete
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Lessons captured
- [ ] Ready for /done command

**Task 3.3: Plan Next Cycle (66)**
- [ ] Run tests and capture results
- [ ] Monitor test execution
- [ ] Collect metrics
- [ ] Prepare for validation

**Task 3.4: Prepare for Future Cycles**
- [ ] Document what works well
- [ ] Identify improvements
- [ ] Plan refinements
- [ ] Update agent specifications

```

## Success Criteria

- ✅ All agent todos created with clear scope
- ✅ Parallel execution across 5 agents
- ✅ 80%+ test coverage
- ✅ All critical paths covered
- ✅ Zero blocking failures
- ✅ Ontology compliance verified

## Next Actions

**IMMEDIATE (Next 5 minutes):**
1. ✅ Finalize director todo (this file)
2. 🎯 Launch agent-quality TODO creation
3. 🎯 Launch agent-frontend TODO creation
4. 🎯 Launch agent-builder TODO creation
5. 🎯 Launch agent-problem-solver TODO creation
6. 🎯 Launch agent-documenter TODO creation

**PARALLEL WORK (agents execute in parallel)**
- Each agent creates detailed task breakdown
- Each agent identifies dependencies
- Each agent provides time/complexity estimates
- Each agent suggests optimizations

**AGGREGATION (once all agents report)**
- Merge all agent plans
- Identify critical paths
- Create unified schedule
- Distribute work

**TRACKING**
- Monitor each agent's progress
- Escalate blockers immediately
- Collect lessons learned
- Prepare advancement summary

---

**Current Status:** 🎯 Ready to launch parallel agents
**Next Command:** Launch 5 agents with TODO creation prompts
**Estimated Time:** 30-45 minutes for complete parallel execution
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-30
