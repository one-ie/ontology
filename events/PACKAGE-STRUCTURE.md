## User Journeys

### Journey 1: Quick Start (CLI Only)

# Creates installation folder
# User gets: one/, .claude/, docs
# Total: 11.4 MB
```

**Perfect for:** Users who just want to create installation folders

### Journey 2: Full Platform (Clone Assembly)

```bash
# Clone complete platform
git clone https://github.com/one-ie/one.git

# User gets: one/, web/, .claude/, docs
# Total: ~65 MB
```

**Perfect for:** Users who want everything ready to go

### Journey 3: Web Development (Clone Web)

# Clone just web app
git clone https://github.com/one-ie/web.git

# User gets: Full Astro + React site
# Total: ~50 MB
```

**Perfect for:** Users building websites only

---

## Why /web is NOT in CLI Package

**Reasons:**
1. **Size:** Web is 50+ MB, would make CLI package too large
2. **Use case:** CLI is for initialization, not development
3. **Updates:** Web changes frequently, CLI changes rarely
4. **Flexibility:** Users can use different frontend frameworks

**How users get /web:**
- Clone from github.com/one-ie/web
- Clone assembly repo (github.com/one-ie/one)
- Sync via release script

---

## Verification

### Check what's in CLI package:

```bash
cd cli
npm pack --dry-run | grep -E "README|LICENSE|SECURITY|TESTING|\.mcp"
```

**Expected output:**
```
.mcp.json             ✓
LICENSE.md            ✓
README.md             ✓
SECURITY.md           ✓
TESTING-ONBOARDING.md ✓
```

### Check what's in Assembly repo:

```bash
ls -la apps/one/
```

**Expected:**
```
one/                  ✓ (ontology docs)
web/                  ✓ (full web app)
README.md             ✓
```

---

## Release Process

### Step 1: Sync Files

```bash
./scripts/release.sh minor
```

**Syncs:**
- Root → cli/ (for npm)
- Root → apps/one/ (for github)
- web/ → apps/one/web/ (full rsync)

### Step 2: Publish CLI

```bash
cd cli
npm publish --access public
```

**Result:** `oneie@3.6.0` on npm with all docs

### Step 3: Push Assembly

```bash
cd apps/one
git push origin main
```

**Result:** Complete platform on github
