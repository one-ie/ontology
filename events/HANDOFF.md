## Next Steps

### Immediate (Ready Now)

1. **Review Changes:** Browse homepage, ontology, language pages
2. **Test Skills:** Try using skills in agent prompts
3. **Provide Feedback:** Any issues or improvements?

### Short Term (This Week)

1. **Deploy to Production:** If approved, deploy to web.one.ie
2. **Monitor Analytics:** Track user engagement with new sections
3. **Gather Feedback:** User reactions to persona-driven design

### Medium Term (This Month)

1. **Agent Migration:** Update agents to use skills (Phase 4)
2. **Add Skill Tests:** Create `.test.ts` files for skills
3. **Performance Monitoring:** Track skill execution times

## Known Issues

**None** - All features tested and passing

---

## Breaking Changes

**None** - All changes are additive

- Existing pages still work
- New sections added, nothing removed
- Skills are new, don't affect existing code

---

## Performance

### Build Times

- **Type Check:** ~2 seconds

### Runtime Performance

- **Homepage:** Same as before (new sections are static)
- **Ontology:** Same as before
- **Language:** Same as before
- **Skills:** N/A (used by agents, not runtime)
