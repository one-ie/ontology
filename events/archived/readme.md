# Archived Documentation

This directory contains markdown files that were automatically moved from the repository root.

## Allowed Root Files

Only these markdown files are allowed in the root directory:

- `README.md` - Project overview
- `CLAUDE.md` - Claude Code instructions
- `AGENTS.md` - AI agent definitions
- `LICENSE.md` - License information
- `SECURITY.md` - Security policy

## Why Files Get Archived

The `clean-root-markdown.sh` hook automatically moves any other markdown files created in the root to this archive directory. This keeps the root directory clean and focused.

**Automatic movement:** When a markdown file is created in the root that isn't in the allowed list, the post-commit hook moves it here with a timestamp to prevent name collisions.

## Using Archived Files

If you need to reference an archived file:

1. Search this directory for the filename (without timestamp)
2. Open the most recent version
3. If you want to restore it to root, manually move it back

Example:
```bash
# Find and restore a file
ls one/events/archived/ | grep IMPLEMENTATION
# Then move it back if needed
```

## Archive Structure

Files are named with timestamps to prevent collisions:
```
ORIGINAL-FILENAME-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.md
```

This ensures:
- Multiple versions with same name don't overwrite
- Clear creation time of the archived version
- Easy sorting by timestamp
