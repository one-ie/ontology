---

## 4. Critical Issues (Immediate Action Required)

### 4.1 Missing Privacy Policy & Terms Acceptance at Signup

**Severity:** CRITICAL (Red)
**Regulation:** GDPR Article 7 (consent conditions), CCPA §1798.140(h), Contract Law
**Risk Level:** HIGH (regulatory fine, unenforceable terms, lawsuits)

**Issue:**
Users can create accounts without reading or accepting the Privacy Policy or Terms of Service. This invalidates consent and makes terms unenforceable.

**Files Affected:**
- `/web/src/pages/account/signup.astro`
- `/web/src/components/auth/SignUpPage.tsx`
- `/web/src/components/auth/SimpleSignUpForm.tsx` (assumed to exist)

**Current State:**
Signup form collects email, username, password but NO checkbox for policy acceptance.

**Required Changes:**
1. Add checkbox above "Create Account" button:
   ```tsx
   <div className="flex items-start gap-2">
     <input
       type="checkbox"
       id="terms-acceptance"
       required
       checked={acceptedTerms}
       onChange={(e) => setAcceptedTerms(e.target.checked)}
     />
     <label htmlFor="terms-acceptance" className="text-sm">
       I have read and accept the{' '}
       <a href="/legal/privacy-policy" target="_blank" className="underline">
         Privacy Policy
       </a>{' '}
       and{' '}
       <a href="/legal/terms-of-service" target="_blank" className="underline">
         Terms of Service
       </a>
     </label>
   </div>
   ```

2. Disable "Create Account" button if checkbox not checked

3. Log acceptance event:
   ```typescript
   await ctx.db.insert('events', {
     groupId: userGroupId,
     type: 'user_registered',
     actorId: userId,
     timestamp: Date.now(),
     metadata: {
       acceptedPrivacyPolicy: true,
       acceptedTermsOfService: true,
       privacyPolicyVersion: '1.0.0',
       termsVersion: '1.0.0',
     },
   });
   ```

**Timeline:** 0-3 days (IMMEDIATE)

---

### 4.2 No Cookie Consent Banner (ePrivacy Directive)

**Severity:** CRITICAL (Red)
**Regulation:** ePrivacy Directive, GDPR Article 6, PECR (UK)
**Risk Level:** HIGH (regulatory fine up to €20 million, unenforceable tracking)

**Issue:**
Platform sets cookies (`better_auth_session`, `theme`, `convex_client_id`) without obtaining prior consent from EU users.

**Files Affected:**
- All pages (no cookie banner implemented anywhere)

**Current State:**
Cookies are set immediately on page load without user consent.

**Required Changes:**
1. Implement cookie consent banner (before ANY non-essential cookies are set):
   ```tsx
   // /web/src/components/CookieBanner.tsx
   import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

   export function CookieBanner() {
     const [show, setShow] = useState(false);

     useEffect(() => {
       const consent = localStorage.getItem('cookie-consent');
       if (!consent) setShow(true);
     }, []);

     const acceptAll = () => {
       localStorage.setItem('cookie-consent', 'all');
       setShow(false);
       // Enable analytics, non-essential cookies
     };

     const acceptEssential = () => {
       localStorage.setItem('cookie-consent', 'essential');
       setShow(false);
       // Only essential cookies (auth, session)
     };

     if (!show) return null;

     return (
       <div className="fixed bottom-0 left-0 right-0 bg-background border-t p-4 z-50">
         <div className="max-w-6xl mx-auto flex flex-col md:flex-row items-center justify-between gap-4">
           <div className="text-sm">
             We use cookies to improve your experience.{' '}
             <a href="/legal/privacy-policy#cookies" className="underline">
               Learn more
             </a>
           </div>
           <div className="flex gap-2">
             <button onClick={acceptEssential} className="btn-secondary">
               Essential Only
             </button>
             <button onClick={acceptAll} className="btn-primary">
               Accept All
             </button>
           </div>
         </div>
       </div>
     );
   }
   ```

2. Add to `Layout.astro`:
   ```astro
   <CookieBanner client:load />
   ```

3. Categorize cookies in privacy policy:
   - **Essential:** Authentication, session management (can be set without consent)
   - **Functional:** Theme preference (requires consent)
   - **Analytics:** (if added later, requires consent)

4. Implement cookie settings page (`/settings/cookies`) where users can change preferences

**Timeline:** 0-7 days (IMMEDIATE)

### 4.3 No Explicit Consent for Biometric Processing (Voice Cloning)

**Severity:** CRITICAL (Red)
**Regulation:** GDPR Article 9 (special category data)
**Risk Level:** VERY HIGH (up to €20 million fine for Article 9 violation)

**Issue:**
Voice cloning processes biometric data (voice characteristics) without explicit consent for special category data processing.

**Files Affected:**
- AI clone creation flow (pages not reviewed but assumed to exist)
- `/backend/convex/mutations/` (AI clone creation mutations)

**Current State:**
Users likely upload audio files for voice cloning without explicit biometric consent.

**Required Changes:**
1. Add biometric consent screen BEFORE audio upload:
   ```tsx
   <div className="border-2 border-orange-500 rounded-lg p-6 bg-orange-50 dark:bg-orange-950">
     <h3 className="font-bold text-lg mb-4">Biometric Data Processing</h3>
     <p className="mb-4">
       Voice cloning involves processing biometric data (your voice characteristics).
       This is considered sensitive data under GDPR Article 9.
     </p>
     <div className="flex items-start gap-2">
       <input
         type="checkbox"
         id="biometric-consent"
         required
         checked={biometricConsent}
         onChange={(e) => setBiometricConsent(e.target.checked)}
       />
       <label htmlFor="biometric-consent" className="text-sm">
         I explicitly consent to voice cloning (biometric data processing)
         for the purpose of creating my AI clone. I understand I can withdraw
         this consent at any time by deleting my AI clone.
       </label>
     </div>
   </div>
   ```

2. Log biometric consent event:
   ```typescript
   await ctx.db.insert('events', {
     type: 'biometric_consent_granted',
     actorId: userId,
     timestamp: Date.now(),
     metadata: {
       processingType: 'voice_cloning',
       purpose: 'ai_clone_creation',
       canWithdraw: true,
     },
   });
   ```

3. Add "Delete Voice Data" button to AI clone settings (separate from deleting entire clone)

4. Update privacy policy with Article 9 disclosure (already included in created policy)

**Timeline:** 0-3 days (IMMEDIATE)

---

### 4.4 No Data Processing Agreements with AI Providers

**Severity:** CRITICAL (Red)
**Regulation:** GDPR Article 28 (processor obligations)
**Risk Level:** HIGH (regulatory fine, unlawful processing)

**Issue:**
No signed Data Processing Agreements (DPAs) with OpenAI or ElevenLabs. Cannot verify they comply with GDPR as data processors.

**Current State:**
Relying on third-party terms of service (not sufficient for GDPR Article 28).

**Required Actions:**

**For OpenAI:**
1. Contact OpenAI to obtain DPA (enterprise customers get this automatically)
2. Verify DPA includes:
   - Data retention period (zero retention for API calls)
   - Sub-processor list
   - Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) for EU transfers
   - Security measures
   - Data subject rights support
   - Breach notification obligations

**For ElevenLabs:**
1. Contact ElevenLabs to request DPA
2. Verify same requirements as OpenAI
3. Confirm audio file deletion after processing (or document retention period)

**Fallback Plan:**
If OpenAI/ElevenLabs refuse to sign DPA:
- Add prominent disclosure: "AI features use third-party services that may not fully comply with GDPR"
- Obtain explicit user consent: "I understand AI features are provided by [OpenAI/ElevenLabs] and may not be GDPR-compliant"
- Consider switching to EU-based AI providers (e.g., Mistral AI, Cohere EU)

**Timeline:** 0-14 days (engage legal counsel if providers refuse)

---

## 5. High Priority Issues (7-30 Days)

### 5.1 No Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) for AI Features

**Severity:** HIGH (Orange)
**Regulation:** GDPR Article 35 (DPIA requirement)
**Risk Level:** MEDIUM-HIGH (regulatory scrutiny, potential enforcement action)

**Issue:**
AI features (clones, agents, embeddings) involve automated decision-making and large-scale processing of personal data. GDPR Article 35 REQUIRES a DPIA before such processing begins.

**DPIA Required For:**
- AI clones (automated profiling, personality analysis)
- Business agents (automated decision-making)
- RAG embeddings (large-scale personal data processing)
- Voice cloning (biometric data processing)

**Current State:**
No DPIA conducted or documented.

**Required Actions:**
1. Conduct DPIA for each AI feature (template: ICO DPIA template)
2. DPIA must include:
   - Description of processing operations
   - Purposes of processing
   - Necessity and proportionality assessment
   - Risks to data subject rights and freedoms
   - Mitigation measures
   - DPO consultation (if applicable)
   - Data subject consultation (if high risk)

3. Document DPIA outcomes:
   - Proceed with processing (risks acceptable)
   - Implement additional safeguards (modify processing)
   - Do not proceed (risks too high)

4. Review and update DPIA annually or when processing changes significantly

**DPIA Consultant:**
Consider hiring GDPR consultant or DPO to conduct professional DPIA.

**Timeline:** 14-30 days (can be done in parallel with other fixes)

---

### 5.2 No User-Facing Data Export Tool (GDPR Article 15)

**Severity:** HIGH (Orange)
**Regulation:** GDPR Article 15 (right of access), CCPA §1798.110
**Risk Level:** MEDIUM (regulatory complaint risk, operational burden)

**Issue:**
Users cannot self-service export their personal data. Must manually request via email (privacy@one.ie), creating operational burden and compliance risk.

**Current State:**
No data export functionality in UI. Privacy policy mentions export capability but not implemented.

**Required Changes:**
1. Add "Export My Data" button to Settings → Privacy page
2. Generate JSON export with:
   - Account data (email, username, profile)
   - Content (all entities owned by user)
   - Connections (relationships involving user)
   - Events (actions performed by user)
   - Knowledge (labels and embeddings linked to user's content)
   - AI clone configurations and training data

3. Implement export API endpoint:
   ```typescript
   // /backend/convex/queries/privacy/export.ts
   export const exportUserData = query({
     handler: async (ctx) => {
       const userId = ctx.auth.getUserIdentity()?.tokenIdentifier;
       if (!userId) throw new Error('Not authenticated');

       const user = await ctx.db.query('entities')
         .filter(q => q.eq(q.field('type'), 'creator'))
         .filter(q => q.eq(q.field('properties.userId'), userId))
         .first();

       if (!user) throw new Error('User not found');

       // Gather all data
       const entities = await ctx.db.query('entities')
         .filter(q => q.eq(q.field('properties.ownerId'), user._id))
         .collect();

       const connections = await ctx.db.query('connections')
         .filter(q => q.or(
           q.eq(q.field('fromEntityId'), user._id),
           q.eq(q.field('toEntityId'), user._id)
         ))
         .collect();

       const events = await ctx.db.query('events')
         .withIndex('by_actor', q => q.eq('actorId', user._id))
         .collect();

       // ... gather knowledge items

       return {
         exportDate: new Date().toISOString(),
         userId: user._id,
         account: { /* user account data */ },
         entities,
         connections,
         events,
         knowledge,
       };
     },
   });
   ```

4. Add download functionality:
   ```tsx
   const exportData = useQuery(api.privacy.exportUserData);

   const downloadExport = () => {
     const blob = new Blob([JSON.stringify(exportData, null, 2)], {
       type: 'application/json',
     });
     const url = URL.createObjectURL(blob);
     const a = document.createElement('a');
     a.href = url;
     a.download = `one-platform-export-${Date.now()}.json`;
     a.click();
   };
   ```

5. Add export history log (to prevent abuse):
   ```typescript
   await ctx.db.insert('events', {
     type: 'data_export_requested',
     actorId: userId,
     timestamp: Date.now(),
     metadata: { exportFormat: 'json' },
   });
   ```

6. Rate limit exports (e.g., max 1 per day per user)

**Timeline:** 14-21 days

---

### 5.3 No User-Facing Activity Log (GDPR Article 15)

**Severity:** HIGH (Orange)
**Regulation:** GDPR Article 15 (right of access)
**Risk Level:** MEDIUM (compliance gap, user trust issue)

**Issue:**
Users cannot view their own activity history (logins, content creation, purchases, AI interactions). Required for GDPR Article 15 transparency.

**Current State:**
Events logged in database but no user-facing UI to view them.

**Required Changes:**
1. Create Activity Log page at `/account/activity`
2. Display paginated event list:
   ```tsx
   <div className="space-y-4">
     {events.map((event) => (
       <div key={event._id} className="border rounded-lg p-4">
         <div className="flex items-start justify-between">
           <div>
             <h4 className="font-semibold">{formatEventType(event.type)}</h4>
             <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground">
               {formatEventDescription(event)}
             </p>
           </div>
           <time className="text-sm text-muted-foreground">
             {formatTimestamp(event.timestamp)}
           </time>
         </div>
         {event.metadata && (
           <details className="mt-2">
             <summary className="cursor-pointer text-sm">Details</summary>
             <pre className="mt-2 text-xs bg-muted p-2 rounded">
               {JSON.stringify(event.metadata, null, 2)}
             </pre>
           </details>
         )}
       </div>
     ))}
   </div>
   ```

3. Add filters:
   - Event type (login, content, purchase, etc.)
   - Date range
   - Search (by description)

4. Implement query:
   ```typescript
   export const getUserActivityLog = query({
     args: {
       limit: v.optional(v.number()),
       offset: v.optional(v.number()),
       eventType: v.optional(v.string()),
     },
     handler: async (ctx, args) => {
       const userId = ctx.auth.getUserIdentity()?.tokenIdentifier;
       if (!userId) throw new Error('Not authenticated');

       let query = ctx.db.query('events')
         .withIndex('by_actor', q => q.eq('actorId', userId))
         .order('desc');

       if (args.eventType) {
         query = query.filter(q => q.eq(q.field('type'), args.eventType));
       }

       const events = await query
         .take(args.limit || 50)
         .skip(args.offset || 0)
         .collect();

       return events;
     },
   });
   ```

5. Add link in Settings menu: "Activity Log"

**Timeline:** 14-21 days

---

### 5.4 No Retention Policy Implementation

**Severity:** HIGH (Orange)
**Regulation:** GDPR Article 5(1)(e) (storage limitation)
**Risk Level:** MEDIUM (compliance violation, unnecessary data storage)

**Issue:**
Events stored indefinitely. Privacy policy states tiered retention (30-90-365 days) but not implemented in code.

**Current State:**
No automated deletion or archival of old events.

**Required Changes:**
1. Implement tiered retention via scheduled Convex action:
   ```typescript
   // /backend/convex/crons/retentionPolicy.ts
   import { cronJobs } from 'convex/server';
   import { internal } from './_generated/api';

   const crons = cronJobs();

   // Run daily at 3am UTC
   crons.daily(
     'retention-policy',
     { hourUTC: 3, minuteUTC: 0 },
     internal.crons.applyRetentionPolicy
   );

   export default crons;
   ```

2. Retention policy logic:
   ```typescript
   export const applyRetentionPolicy = internalMutation({
     handler: async (ctx) => {
       const now = Date.now();
       const thirtyDaysAgo = now - 30 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000;
       const ninetyDaysAgo = now - 90 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000;
       const oneYearAgo = now - 365 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000;
       const sevenYearsAgo = now - 7 * 365 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000;

       // Hot → Warm (30 days): Mark for limited indexing
       const hotEvents = await ctx.db.query('events')
         .withIndex('by_timestamp', q => q.lt('timestamp', thirtyDaysAgo))
         .filter(q => !q.field('metadata.retentionTier'))
         .collect();

       for (const event of hotEvents) {
         await ctx.db.patch(event._id, {
           metadata: { ...event.metadata, retentionTier: 'warm' },
         });
       }

       // Warm → Cold (90 days): Anonymize actor IDs (except financial)
       const warmEvents = await ctx.db.query('events')
         .withIndex('by_timestamp', q => q.lt('timestamp', ninetyDaysAgo))
         .filter(q => q.eq(q.field('metadata.retentionTier'), 'warm'))
         .filter(q => !isFinancialEvent(q.field('type')))
         .collect();

       for (const event of warmEvents) {
         await ctx.db.patch(event._id, {
           actorId: 'anonymized' as any, // Anonymize
           metadata: { ...event.metadata, retentionTier: 'cold' },
         });
       }

       // Cold → Archive (1 year): Export to data warehouse, delete from primary DB
       const coldEvents = await ctx.db.query('events')
         .withIndex('by_timestamp', q => q.lt('timestamp', oneYearAgo))
         .filter(q => q.eq(q.field('metadata.retentionTier'), 'cold'))
         .filter(q => !isFinancialEvent(q.field('type')))
         .collect();

       // Export to S3/data warehouse (implementation depends on setup)
       // await exportToWarehouse(coldEvents);

       for (const event of coldEvents) {
         await ctx.db.delete(event._id);
       }

       // Financial events: Keep for 7 years, then archive
       const oldFinancialEvents = await ctx.db.query('events')
         .withIndex('by_timestamp', q => q.lt('timestamp', sevenYearsAgo))
         .filter(q => isFinancialEvent(q.field('type')))
         .collect();

       // Export and delete
       for (const event of oldFinancialEvents) {
         // await exportToWarehouse([event]);
         await ctx.db.delete(event._id);
       }
     },
   });

   function isFinancialEvent(type: string): boolean {
     return [
       'tokens_purchased',
       'payment_processed',
       'subscription_updated',
       // ... other financial event types
     ].includes(type);
   }
   ```

3. Document retention policy in privacy policy (already included)

4. Add user notification: "Old activity logs are automatically deleted per our retention policy"

**Timeline:** 21-30 days (requires careful testing)

---

### 5.5 Missing Legal Disclosures on Public Pages

**Severity:** HIGH (Orange)
**Regulation:** GDPR Article 13 (information to be provided), Consumer Protection
**Risk Level:** MEDIUM (transparency violation, user confusion)

**Issue:**
Public pages (index, blog, features) lack links to Privacy Policy and Terms of Service.

**Files Affected:**
- `/web/src/pages/index.astro` (homepage)
- `/web/src/pages/blogs/index.astro`
- All other public pages

**Current State:**
No footer links to legal documents on most pages.

             Cookie Policy
           </a>
           <a href="mailto:legal@one.ie" class="hover:underline">
             Contact Legal
           </a>
         </nav>
       </div>
       <div class="text-xs text-muted-foreground mt-4 text-center">
         Powered by ONE |{' '}
         <a href="https://one.ie" target="_blank" class="hover:underline">
           https://one.ie
         </a>
       </div>
     </div>
   </footer>
   ```

2. Ensure all pages use Layout.astro (verify)

3. Add "Legal" section to main navigation menu

4. Create legal pages directory:
   - `/web/src/pages/legal/privacy-policy.astro` → Serve `/one/things/legal/privacy-policy.md`
   - `/web/src/pages/legal/terms-of-service.astro` → Serve `/one/things/legal/terms-of-service.md`
   - `/web/src/pages/legal/cookies.astro` → Link to privacy policy cookies section

**Timeline:** 7-14 days

---

## 6. Medium Priority Issues (30-90 Days)

### 6.1 No Data Minimization Validation

**Severity:** MEDIUM (Yellow)
**Regulation:** GDPR Article 5(1)(c) (data minimization)
**Risk Level:** MEDIUM (compliance gap, potential over-collection)

**Issue:**
Entity `properties` field accepts `any` type without validation. Could lead to over-collection of personal data.

**Remediation:**
1. Define schemas for each entity type's properties using Zod
2. Validate properties on entity creation/update
3. Reject fields not in schema

**Timeline:** 30-60 days

---

### 6.2 No Group Owner Data Controller Training

**Severity:** MEDIUM (Yellow)
**Regulation:** GDPR Article 28 (processor instructions to controller)
**Risk Level:** MEDIUM (group owners unaware of responsibilities)

**Issue:**
Group owners are data controllers but receive no training or guidance on GDPR obligations.

**Remediation:**
1. Create group owner onboarding guide (GDPR basics)
2. Provide DPA template for group owners to use with group users
3. Add "Compliance" section to group owner dashboard
4. Email quarterly compliance reminders

**Timeline:** 30-60 days

---

### 6.3 No Consent Management for AI Features

**Severity:** MEDIUM (Yellow)
**Regulation:** GDPR Article 6 (lawful basis), Article 7 (consent)
**Risk Level:** MEDIUM (consent validity, user control)

**Issue:**
AI features (embeddings, clones, agents) enabled by default without explicit opt-in.

**Remediation:**
1. Add AI features consent toggle in Settings → Privacy
2. Disable AI features by default for new users (opt-in required)
3. Show consent modal on first AI feature use
4. Allow granular consent (embeddings separate from clones separate from agents)

**Timeline:** 30-60 days

---

### 6.4 No Breach Notification Procedures

**Severity:** MEDIUM (Yellow)
**Regulation:** GDPR Article 33-34 (breach notification)
**Risk Level:** MEDIUM (response readiness)

**Issue:**
No documented breach response plan. GDPR requires notification within 72 hours.

**Remediation:**
1. Create breach response plan document
2. Define breach detection procedures
3. Define breach assessment criteria (severity, scope)
4. Create notification templates (users, regulators)
5. Assign breach response team roles
6. Conduct annual breach response drills

**Timeline:** 30-90 days (engage security consultant)

---

### 6.5 No Data Subject Request (DSR) Workflow

**Severity:** MEDIUM (Yellow)
**Regulation:** GDPR Articles 15-22 (data subject rights)
**Risk Level:** MEDIUM (operational burden, compliance risk)

**Issue:**
No internal workflow for handling DSRs (access, rectification, erasure, etc.). Currently ad-hoc email requests.

**Remediation:**
1. Create internal DSR ticketing system
2. Define SLAs (30 days for GDPR, 45 days for CCPA)
3. Create DSR response templates
4. Train support team on DSR handling
5. Implement identity verification process for DSRs
6. Log all DSRs in compliance database

**Timeline:** 60-90 days

---

## 7. Low Priority Issues (Ongoing)

### 7.1 No Privacy-by-Default Settings

**Severity:** LOW (Green)
**Risk Level:** LOW (user experience, trust)

**Issue:**
New accounts have all features enabled by default (should be opt-in for privacy-sensitive features).

**Remediation:**
- Set AI embeddings to off by default
- Set profile visibility to private by default
- Require explicit opt-in for external integrations

**Timeline:** Ongoing improvement

---

### 7.2 No Regular Compliance Audits

**Severity:** LOW (Green)
**Risk Level:** LOW (long-term compliance drift)

**Issue:**
No schedule for regular privacy/security audits.

**Remediation:**
- Quarterly privacy self-audits
- Annual external privacy audit (GDPR consultant)
- Annual penetration testing (security)
- Continuous compliance monitoring

**Timeline:** Implement schedule (ongoing)

---

### 7.3 No Public Transparency Reports

**Severity:** LOW (Green)
**Risk Level:** LOW (trust, transparency)

**Issue:**

## 12. Conclusion

**Summary:**
ONE Platform has a strong architectural foundation with privacy-by-design principles evident in its 6-dimension ontology. Multi-tenant isolation, role-based access control, and hierarchical group management demonstrate thoughtful privacy engineering.

**However**, several critical legal compliance gaps must be addressed immediately:
1. Missing privacy policy & terms acceptance at signup (contract law violation)
2. No cookie consent mechanism (ePrivacy Directive violation)
3. No explicit consent for biometric processing (GDPR Article 9 violation)
4. No signed DPAs with AI processors (GDPR Article 28 violation)

**Overall Risk Assessment:** MEDIUM-HIGH

**Risk Factors:**
- Critical issues present immediate regulatory and legal risk
- High priority issues create compliance gaps
- No DPIAs conducted (GDPR Article 35 requirement)
- No formal breach response plan
- Reliance on third-party AI providers without verified DPAs

**Risk Mitigation:**
If all recommendations are implemented per the roadmap:
- **0-7 days:** Risk reduced to MEDIUM (critical issues resolved)
- **7-30 days:** Risk reduced to LOW-MEDIUM (high priority issues resolved)
- **30-90 days:** Risk reduced to LOW (medium priority issues resolved)
- **Ongoing:** Risk maintained at LOW with continuous monitoring

**Regulatory Exposure:**
- **GDPR fines:** Up to €20 million or 4% of global revenue (whichever is higher)
- **CCPA fines:** Up to $7,500 per intentional violation
- **PIPEDA fines:** Up to CAD $100,000 per violation
- **Reputational damage:** User trust, press coverage, customer churn
- **Civil lawsuits:** Class action risk, individual lawsuits

**Positive Aspects:**
- Strong ontology-aligned data model
- Privacy-by-design architecture
- Multi-tenant isolation
- Granular role-based access control
- Comprehensive audit logging
- Local hosting option (data sovereignty)

**Path Forward:**
Follow the remediation roadmap in Section 9:
- **Phase 1 (0-7 days):** Critical fixes (TOS/Privacy acceptance, cookie consent, biometric consent)
- **Phase 2 (7-30 days):** High priority (DPAs, data export, activity log, legal disclosures)
- **Phase 3 (30-90 days):** Medium priority (data minimization, consent management, breach response)
- **Phase 4 (Ongoing):** Continuous compliance (audits, training, monitoring)

**Final Recommendation:**
**Engage legal counsel immediately** to review this assessment and the created legal documents. While this AI-powered assessment is comprehensive, human legal review is essential before deployment to production.

**Contact for Legal Review:**
- Irish privacy lawyer (GDPR specialist)
- Email: legal@one.ie (after lawyer engaged)
