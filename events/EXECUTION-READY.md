## Quick Facts

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total Agents | 6 (1 director + 5 specialists) |
| Total Tasks | 127+ tasks |
| Total Test Cases | 800+ |
| Timeline | 5-8 days (parallel) |
| Quality Gates | 6 gates |
| Success Criteria | All gates pass |
| Documentation Files | 13 to create |
| Knowledge Entries | 50+ with embeddings |
| Coverage Target | 80%+ code coverage |
| Pass Rate Target | 95%+ tests passing |
| Accessibility Target | 90%+ WCAG AA |

## Dependencies & Coordination

### Parallel (No Dependencies)
- Quality Agent: Independent
- Frontend Agent: Independent
- Builder Agent: Independent
- Documenter Agent: Independent (starts with Phase 1)

### Sequential (Has Dependencies)
- Problem Solver Agent: Waits for test failures (Day 5+)
- Director: Validates after all agents complete (Day 8)

### Estimated Parallelization Savings
- Sequential approach: 10-12 days
- Parallel approach: 5-8 days
- **Time savings: 2-4 days (25-40% faster)**

---

## Risk Mitigation

### If Tests Fail
→ Problem Solver analyzes root causes
→ Specific agents apply targeted fixes
→ Iterate until all pass

### If Quality Gate Fails
→ Don't advance
→ Identify blocker
→ Resolve before proceeding
→ Re-test and validate

### If Timeline Slips
→ Parallelize more aggressively
→ Identify critical path tasks
→ Add resources to bottleneck
→ Escalate to director

### If Ontology Issues Found
→ Director escalates
→ Resolve in context
→ Update tests
→ Validate compliance

## Next Command

When ready to begin parallel execution:

```bash
# Each agent begins their Phase 1 tasks simultaneously
# Director monitors and tracks progress
# Daily stand-ups at [TIME]
# Go/no-go checkpoints at: Day 2, Day 5, Day 7
```

---

## Summary

All 6 specialized agents have comprehensive TODO lists that enable:

✅ **Parallel execution** - Save 2-4 days
✅ **Complete coverage** - 800+ test cases
✅ **Clear dependencies** - Know what blocks what
✅ **Measurable progress** - 127+ tasks with acceptance criteria
✅ **Quality gates** - 6 validation points
✅ **Knowledge capture** - 50+ embeddings for future agents
✅ **Professional docs** - 22 planning files ready to execute

**The platform is ready for the largest coordinated testing effort.**
