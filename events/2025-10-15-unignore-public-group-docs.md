# ✅ Public Group Docs Restored to Git

**Date:** 2025-10-15 03:45 UTC
**Agent:** Clean Agent
**Mission:** Unignore `groups.md` and `one.md` while keeping sensitive files private
**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE**

---

## Executive Summary

Successfully restored `groups.md` and `one.md` to git tracking while maintaining privacy for sensitive business files (`revenue.md`, `strategy.md`, `vision.md`).

**Results:**
- ✅ `groups.md` - Public group dimension docs (visible in git)
- ✅ `one.md` - Public platform specs (visible in git)
- 🔒 `revenue.md` - Private revenue strategy (hidden from git)
- 🔒 `strategy.md` - Private business strategy (hidden from git)
- 🔒 `vision.md` - Private vision docs (hidden from git)

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `.gitignore` - Selective Hiding

**Before (hid entire directory):**
```gitignore
# Private business files
groups/
```

**After (hid only 3 specific files):**
```gitignore
# Private business files (backed up in /one-group/)
# Public docs: groups.md, one.md (visible in git)
# Private docs: revenue.md, strategy.md, vision.md (hidden from git)
groups/revenue.md
groups/strategy.md
groups/vision.md
```

### 2. Restored Files to Git Tracking

**Commands executed:**
```bash
cd /one
git add groups/groups.md groups/one.md
```

**Result:**
- `groups/groups.md` - Added back to git (A)
- `groups/one.md` - Added back to git (A)

### 3. Restored Missing Files from Backup

The 3 private files were accidentally removed from disk during previous operation. Restored from `/one-group/` backup:

```bash
cp /one-group/groups/revenue.md /one/groups/
cp /one-group/groups/strategy.md /one/groups/
cp /one-group/groups/vision.md /one/groups/
```

---

## Current State

### Files on Disk (All 5 Present)

```bash
$ ls -lh /one/groups/
-rw-r--r--  14K  groups.md    ← ✅ PUBLIC (in git)
-rw-r--r--  12K  one.md       ← ✅ PUBLIC (in git)
-rw-r--r--  20K  revenue.md   ← 🔒 PRIVATE (ignored by git)
-rw-r--r--  23K  strategy.md  ← 🔒 PRIVATE (ignored by git)
-rw-r--r--  4.8K vision.md    ← 🔒 PRIVATE (ignored by git)
```

### Git Tracking Status

**Tracked files:**
```bash
$ git ls-files groups/
groups/groups.md  ✅
groups/one.md     ✅
```

**Ignored files:**
```bash
$ git check-ignore groups/*
groups/revenue.md  🔒
groups/strategy.md 🔒
groups/vision.md   🔒
```

**Git status:**
```bash
$ git status --short
M .gitignore
A groups/groups.md
A groups/one.md
```

## Why This Configuration?

### Public Files (Visible in Git)

**`groups.md` (14 KB)**
- Documents the Groups dimension of the 6-dimension ontology
- Explains how groups work in the ONE platform
- Technical documentation, not business-sensitive
- **Safe to share publicly**

**`one.md` (12 KB)**
- Specifications for the ONE platform group
- Technical architecture and design
- Implementation details
- **Safe to share publicly**

### Private Files (Hidden from Git)

**`revenue.md` (20 KB)**
- Revenue strategy and financial projections
- Pricing models and monetization plans
- Competitive financial analysis
- **Business-sensitive, must stay private**

**`strategy.md` (23 KB)**
- Business strategy and market positioning
- Competitive analysis and tactics
- Go-to-market plans
- **Business-sensitive, must stay private**

**`vision.md` (4.8 KB)**
- Long-term vision and strategic goals
- Internal roadmap and priorities
- Leadership messaging
- **Business-sensitive, must stay private**

---

## Ontology Alignment

This configuration properly separates:

1. **Public Platform Documentation** (in git)
   - How the ontology works
   - Technical specifications
   - Implementation guides

2. **Private Business Strategy** (not in git, backed up locally)
   - Revenue and financial plans
   - Competitive strategy
   - Internal vision and goals

Both follow the same 6-dimension ontology structure, just with different access levels.

---

## Backup Status

### `/one-group/groups/` - Private Backup

**Still contains all 5 files:**
- groups.md (backup, though now also public)
- one.md (backup, though now also public)
- revenue.md ← PRIMARY BACKUP
- strategy.md ← PRIMARY BACKUP
- vision.md ← PRIMARY BACKUP

**Updated README.md** to reflect that groups.md and one.md are now public.

## Git Commit Checklist

**Ready to commit:**
```bash
cd /one
git commit -m "feat: restore public group docs to git tracking

- groups.md: Group dimension documentation (public)
- one.md: ONE platform specifications (public)
- Keep revenue.md, strategy.md, vision.md private (backed up in /one-group/)
- Update .gitignore for selective file hiding"

git push origin main
```

**After commit:**
- ✅ Public docs visible in GitHub
- ✅ Private files remain hidden
- ✅ Backup preserved in `/one-group/`

---

## Maintenance

### Adding New Public Files

To make a file in `groups/` public:
```bash
cd /one
git add groups/<filename>
git commit -m "docs: add <filename> to public documentation"
```

### Hiding New Private Files

To hide a file from git:
1. Add to `/one/.gitignore`:
   ```gitignore
   groups/<filename>
   ```
2. Remove from git tracking:
   ```bash
   git rm --cached groups/<filename>
   ```
3. Backup to `/one-group/groups/`

## Verification Tests

### ✅ All Files on Disk
```bash
$ ls /one/groups/
groups.md ✓
one.md ✓
revenue.md ✓
strategy.md ✓
vision.md ✓
```

### ✅ Public Files Tracked
```bash
$ git ls-files groups/
groups/groups.md ✓
groups/one.md ✓
```

### ✅ Private Files Ignored
```bash
$ git check-ignore groups/revenue.md
groups/revenue.md ✓
```

### ✅ Backup Intact
```bash
$ ls /one-group/groups/
groups.md ✓
one.md ✓
revenue.md ✓
strategy.md ✓
vision.md ✓
```

- All 5 files on disk
- Selective .gitignore
- Backup preserved

**Ontology alignment:** Perfect separation of public platform docs vs private business strategy.
