## KEY CHARACTERISTICS OF THIS PLAN

### 1. Cycle-Based Planning
- Not time-based ("2 weeks per file")
- Sequence-based (100 cycles per file)
- Precise (each cycle is a step)
- Context-light (can execute independently)

### 2. Parallel Execution
- Waves 1-2: Sequential (Wave 1 → Wave 2)
- Within Wave: Parallel (3 files at once)
- Maximum 6 agents working simultaneously
- Estimated 900 cycles in 8 weeks

### 3. Ontology-First
- Every feature maps to 6 dimensions (groups, people, things, connections, events, knowledge)
- Ontology validated in Cycle 1 of every file
- Database schema derives from ontology
- No schema-first, no feature-first

### 4. Consistent Structure
- All files follow same 10-phase structure
- Cycle 1-10: Foundation & planning
- Cycle 11-20: Backend schema & services
- Cycle 21-30: Frontend components
- Cycle 31-40+: Feature-specific work
- Cycle 51-60: Quality & testing
- Cycle 61-70: Design & refinement
- Cycle 71-80: Performance & optimization
- Cycle 81-90: Deployment & documentation
- Cycle 91-100: Knowledge & lessons learned

### 5. Quality by Default
- Tests written during implementation (not Phase 6)
- Documentation written as you go (not Phase 9)
- Code review daily (not batch)
- Performance monitored from start (not optimization phase)

## DEPENDENCIES & CRITICAL PATH

**Critical Path:** Features that block others

```
todo-x402.md (DONE)
    ↓
todo-onboard.md (Wave 1) ← Blocks all others
    ↓
todo-agents.md (Wave 2A) ← Blocks Wave 3
todo-skills.md (Wave 2B) ← Blocks Wave 3
todo-sell.md (Wave 2C) ← Blocks Wave 3
    ↓
todo-ecommerce.md (Wave 3A) ← Blocks Wave 4
todo-api.md (Wave 3B) ← Blocks Wave 4
todo-features.md (Wave 3C) ← Blocks Wave 4
    ↓
todo-one-ie.md (Wave 4) ← Blocks public launch
```

**Parallel Paths:** Work that can happen simultaneously
- Wave 2: agents, skills, sell can work in parallel (no dependencies)
- Wave 3: ecommerce, api, features can work in parallel (all depend on Wave 2, not each other)
- Wave 4: one-ie depends on all, works solo

- ❌ Code reviews (done during execution)
- ❌ Bug fixes (discovered during testing, handled in iterations)
- ❌ Phase 2 enhancements (planned separately after v2.0.0)

This plan ONLY includes:
- ✅ Strategic overview
- ✅ Detailed planning for 900 cycles
- ✅ Specialist assignments
- ✅ Timeline and dependencies
- ✅ Release schedule
- ✅ Coordination approach
