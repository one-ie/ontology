| Aspect | Status | Score | Impact |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| Frontmatter Structure | ✅ Perfect | 100% | All files consistent YAML |

### What Needs Improvement (Priority Order)

| Priority | Issue | Files Affected | Solution Time |
|----------|-------|-----------------|--------|
| 1️⃣ HIGH | Knowledge integration minimal (20%) | All 25 TODOs | 6-8 hours |
| 2️⃣ HIGH | Lessons learned not captured (40%) | All 25 TODOs | 8-10 hours |
| 3️⃣ MEDIUM | Incomplete files (4-6 files) | todo-api, buy-chatgpt, etc | 8-12 hrs/file |
| 4️⃣ MEDIUM | Missing Wave 2 TODOs (3 files) | todo-agents, skills, sell | 8-10 hrs/file |
| 5️⃣ LOW | Code example context sparse (8%) | todo-components, ai, effects | 2-3 hours |

---

## Top 5 Strengths

### 1. Frontmatter Consistency (100%)
**Every file** uses identical YAML structure:
```yaml
---
title: [Name]
dimension: [One of 6]
category: [filename].md
tags: [comma-separated]
related_dimensions: [comma-separated]
scope: global|installation|group
created: YYYY-MM-DD
updated: YYYY-MM-DD
version: 1.0.0
ai_context: |
  [AI agent guidance]
---
```

**Why It Matters:** AI agents can reliably parse metadata → automatic indexing

### 2. Inference Structure (98%)
**Almost all feature TODOs** follow 100-inference template:
- Phase 1 (Infer 1-10): Foundation
- Phase 2 (Infer 11-20): Backend
- Phase 3-10: Features → Testing → Deployment

**Why It Matters:** Predictable pacing → parallel execution possible

### 3. Ontology Alignment (98%)
**Every feature** maps to 6 dimensions:
- Groups (multi-tenancy)
- People (authorization)
- Things (entities)
- Connections (relationships)
- Events (actions)
- Knowledge (understanding)

**Why It Matters:** Universal architecture → 98% AI code generation accuracy

### 4. Readable Organization (96%)
**Clear hierarchy** across files:
- Master plan → Wave assignments → Individual TODOs → Implementation details
- Cross-references enable dependency discovery
- Visual enhancements (emoji, checkmarks) improve scanning

**Why It Matters:** Humans can quickly navigate complex documentation

### 5. Practical Examples (92%)
**Most files** include working TypeScript code:
- Schema examples
- Mutation/query patterns
- Service implementations
- Component examples

**Why It Matters:** Developers can copy and adapt → faster implementation

---

## Top 5 Gaps

### 1. Knowledge Artifacts Not Specified (80% Missing)
**Problem:** TODO files document what to build, but don't specify what knowledge chunks to create after.

**Impact:**
- No semantic learning from implementations
- Future AI agents can't discover past solutions
- RAG/embeddings underutilized

**Solution:** Add "Knowledge Artifacts" section to each TODO specifying:
- Knowledge type (chunk/label)
- Content size (200-500 tokens)
- Labels (feature:*, technology:*, pattern:*)
- Embedding model (text-embedding-3-large)
- Discovery use cases

**Example:**
```markdown
## Knowledge Artifacts to Create

### Chunk 1: Creator Onboarding Flow
- Type: chunk
- Size: 250 tokens
- Content: High-level flow from signup to first earnings
- Labels: feature:creator_onboarding, technology:better_auth, pattern:wizard
- Use Case: Help new creators understand sequence
```

**Time to Implement:** 6-8 hours (all TODOs)

---

### 2. Lessons Learned Not Captured (60% Missing)
**Problem:** Complex implementations finish without documenting what was learned.

**Impact:**
- Repeated mistakes in similar features
- No institutional knowledge accumulation
- Specialist experience lost

**Solution:** Add "Lessons Learned" section to each TODO after completion capturing:
- Problems encountered
- Root causes
- Solutions applied
- Prevention strategies
- Specialist tips

**Format:**
```markdown
## Lessons Learned from Implementation

### Pattern: [Name]
**Problem:** [What went wrong]
**Root Cause:** [Why]
**Solution:** [How fixed]
**Prevention:** [Avoid in future]
**Specialist Tip:** [Experience-based advice]
```

**Time to Implement:** 8-10 hours (capture from past + future)

---

### 3. Incomplete Feature Specifications (4-6 Files)
**Problem:** Several TODO files created but not fully documented.

**Affected Files:**
- todo-api.md (truncated)
- todo-buy-chatgpt.md (missing phases 4-10)
- todo-frontend-effects.md (missing detailed implementations)
- todo-connections.md (schema only, no implementation)

**Impact:**
- Incomplete planning for Wave 3 features
- Uncertainty for specialists on scope
- Difficult to estimate effort

**Solution:** Complete all 100-inference sequences with:
- Phase breakdown
- Inference-level detail
- Implementation examples
- Integration points

**Time to Implement:** 8-12 hours per file (3-4 files = 24-48 hours)

---

### 4. Missing Wave 2 Features (3 Files Not Created)
**Problem:** Master plan calls for Wave 2 (agents, skills, sell) but TODOs don't exist.

**Affected Wave 2 Features:**
- todo-agents.md (agent deployment framework)
- todo-skills.md (skill marketplace)
- todo-sell.md (product sales integration)

**Impact:**
- 300 inferences planned but unspecified
- Uncertain specialist assignments
- Difficult to estimate timeline

**Solution:** Create 100-inference specifications for each:
- Ontology mapping
- Feature phases
- Integration points
- Specialist assignments
- Success criteria

**Time to Implement:** 8-10 hours each (3 files = 24-30 hours)

---

### 5. Code Examples Lack Context (8% Missing)
**Problem:** Code snippets sometimes don't show where code lives.

**Affected Files:**
- todo-components.md (Effect.ts patterns need file context)
- todo-ai.md (LLM service examples unclear)
- todo-effects.md (service definitions need placement)

**Impact:**
- Developers unsure where to put code
- Copy-paste errors from incorrect context
- Integration mistakes

**Solution:** Every code example must include:
```typescript
// File: backend/convex/services/[service-name].ts
// Purpose: [What this does]
// Dependencies: [Other services/libraries]

[Full working example]
```

**Time to Implement:** 2-3 hours (audit + fix)

---

## Quick Wins (Easy Fixes)

### 1. Standardize Code Example Headers
**Current:** Some examples missing context
**Target:** Every example has file location comment
**Time:** 1 hour
**Files:** 5 files (components, ai, effects, api, features)

### 2. Add Cross-Reference Section to All TODOs
**Current:** Some dependencies not reciprocal
**Target:** Every TODO links to what depends on it
**Time:** 2-3 hours
**Pattern:**
```markdown
## Dependency Map

### Depends On
- todo-onboard.md (Wave 1 foundation)

### Related Work
- todo-ecommerce.md (runs in parallel)

### Depends On This
- todo-api.md (needs product endpoints)
```

### 3. Add Status Badges to Inference Sections
**Current:** No visual indication of completion
**Target:** Each inference marked ✅/⏳/☐
**Time:** 1-2 hours
**Benefit:** Easy to see progress during implementation

### 4. Create Acceptance Criteria Template
**Current:** No explicit success criteria
**Target:** Phase 1 of every TODO includes criteria
**Time:** 2 hours (template creation + examples)

---

## Key Insight: The 80/20 Rule

**Current State:**
- ✅ 80% of documentation work is DONE (frontmatter, structure, examples)
- ⚠️ 20% remains (knowledge integration, lessons, completeness)

**This 20% is CRITICAL because:**
1. It enables AI learning from past implementations
2. It powers semantic search across documentation
3. It converts specialist expertise into institutional knowledge
4. It prevents repeated mistakes

**Bottom Line:** Getting to 98% compliance requires focused effort on the knowledge dimension, not massive rewrites.

---

## For AI Agents: How to Use This Report

### If implementing a new TODO:
1. Use `one/knowledge/rules.md` + `one/connections/workflow.md` for structure
2. Reference `one/things/todo-onboard.md` as template (exemplary compliance)
3. Include "Knowledge Artifacts" section in Phase 1
4. Mark each inference ✅/⏳/☐ as you progress
5. Capture lessons learned at end of each phase

### If reviewing documentation:
1. Check frontmatter matches template (should be 100%)
2. Verify ontology mapping in Phase 1 Infer 2
3. Scan for code examples and verify file paths
4. Look for cross-references to related TODOs
5. Check for completeness (all 100 inferences addressed)

### If adding knowledge:
1. Read `one/knowledge/knowledge.md` to understand chunk structure
2. Extract 200-500 token chunks from implementations
3. Add embeddings using text-embedding-3-large model
4. Link to feature via sourceThingId (not junction table)
5. Tag with feature:*, technology:*, pattern:* labels
