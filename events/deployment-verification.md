**Date:** 2025-10-16
**Agent:** agent-ops
**Status:** Ready for Testing

## Pre-Deployment Verification

### 1. Files Created âœ…

- [x] `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` - CI/CD pipeline
- [x] `scripts/deploy-with-installation.sh` - Deployment script (executable)
- [x] `scripts/backup-installation.sh` - Backup script (executable)
- [x] `scripts/validate-deployment.sh` - Validation script (executable)
- [x] `one/events/deployment-installation-folders.md` - Deployment guide
- [x] `one/events/deployment-ops-summary.md` - Implementation summary
- [x] `one/events/deployment-verification.md` - This checklist

### 2. Files Modified âœ…

- [x] `web/wrangler.toml` - Added environment configurations
- [x] `web/package.json` - Added deployment scripts
- [x] `.claude/commands/release.md` - Added installation folder sync

### 3. Script Permissions âœ…

```bash
-rwxr-xr-x  deploy-with-installation.sh
-rwxr-xr-x  backup-installation.sh
-rwxr-xr-x  validate-deployment.sh
```

All scripts are executable.

### 4. Script Validation

#### Test deploy-with-installation.sh (Dry Run)
```bash
# Should fail gracefully if installation folder doesn't exist
INSTALLATION_NAME=test-install ./scripts/deploy-with-installation.sh

# Expected output: Warning about missing folder, continues with global /one/
```

#### Test backup-installation.sh
```bash
# Should create backup if folder exists
./scripts/backup-installation.sh one-group

# Expected: Creates backups/installations/one-group-TIMESTAMP.tar.gz
```

#### Test validate-deployment.sh
```bash
# Should check environment and run tests
PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL=https://shocking-falcon-870.convex.cloud ./scripts/validate-deployment.sh

# Expected: Runs tests, type checking, build validation
```

## CI/CD Pipeline Verification

### GitHub Actions Workflow

**Triggers:**
- [x] Push to main branch
- [x] Pull request to main branch

**Jobs:**
1. **test** (runs on all pushes/PRs)
   - [x] Setup Bun
   - [x] Install dependencies (web + cli)
   - [x] Run tests (web + cli)
   - [x] Type check (astro check)

2. **build-web** (runs after test)
   - [x] Check installation folder existence
   - [x] Set environment variables
   - [x] Build web application
   - [x] Upload dist artifact

3. **deploy-cloudflare** (main branch only)
   - [x] Download build artifact
   - [x] Deploy to Cloudflare Pages
   - [x] Use project name: "web"

4. **deploy-convex** (main branch only)
   - [x] Setup Node.js
   - [x] Deploy to Convex
   - [x] Use CONVEX_DEPLOY_KEY

### Required GitHub Secrets

Before first deployment, add these secrets to repository:

```
INSTALLATION_NAME (optional, defaults to 'one-group')
PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL (required)
CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN (required)
CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID (required)
CONVEX_DEPLOY_KEY (required)
```

## Environment Configuration Verification

### Wrangler Configuration

**Base Configuration:**
- [x] Project name: "web"
- [x] Compatibility date: 2024-09-25
- [x] Node.js compatibility enabled
- [x] KV namespace binding for SESSION

**Production Environment:**
- [x] Custom domain: web.one.ie
- [x] INSTALLATION_NAME variable
- [x] PUBLIC_INSTALLATION_NAME variable

**Preview Environment:**
- [x] INSTALLATION_NAME variable
- [x] PUBLIC_INSTALLATION_NAME variable

### Package Scripts

**New Scripts Added:**
```json
{
  "deploy": "../scripts/deploy-with-installation.sh",
  "deploy:preview": "wrangler pages deploy dist --project-name=web --branch=preview",
  "validate": "../scripts/validate-deployment.sh"
}
```

**Usage:**
```bash
cd web
bun run validate       # Pre-deployment checks
bun run deploy         # Full deployment
bun run deploy:preview # Preview deployment
```

## Testing Checklist

### Unit Tests
- [ ] Test deployment script with no installation folder
- [ ] Test deployment script with installation folder
- [ ] Test backup script creates archive
- [ ] Test backup script retention policy (keeps 10)
- [ ] Test validation script catches missing env vars
- [ ] Test validation script validates folder structure

### Integration Tests
- [ ] Full deployment flow (validate â†’ backup â†’ deploy)
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline runs on PR
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline deploys on main push
- [ ] Cloudflare deployment includes installation files
- [ ] Convex deployment succeeds
- [ ] Environment variables properly passed

### Manual Verification
- [ ] Create test installation folder
- [ ] Run validation script
- [ ] Run backup script
- [ ] Run deployment script
- [ ] Verify web deployment
- [ ] Verify backend deployment
- [ ] Check Cloudflare Pages logs
- [ ] Check Convex deployment logs

## Rollback Procedures

### Web Rollback
```bash
# List deployments
wrangler pages deployment list --project-name=web

# Rollback via Cloudflare dashboard (CLI not supported)
# Navigate to: Cloudflare Dashboard â†’ Pages â†’ web â†’ Deployments
```

### Installation Folder Rollback
```bash
# Find backup
ls -lah backups/installations/

# Restore
tar -xzf backups/installations/[name]-[timestamp].tar.gz -C /

# Verify
ls -la /[installation-name]/
```

### Convex Rollback
```bash
# Convex doesn't support direct rollback
# Need to redeploy previous version from git

git checkout [previous-commit]
cd backend
npx convex deploy
git checkout main
```

## Monitoring Setup

   - [ ] Set up Convex production deployment
   - [ ] Create installation folder (if needed)

2. **Testing**
   - [ ] Run validation script
   - [ ] Test backup/restore
   - [ ] Verify build succeeds
   - [ ] Run full test suite

3. **Documentation**
   - [ ] Review deployment guide
   - [ ] Create incident response runbook
   - [ ] Document rollback procedures
   - [ ] Set up monitoring alerts

4. **Communication**
   - [ ] Notify team of deployment
   - [ ] Schedule deployment window
   - [ ] Prepare rollback plan
   - [ ] Monitor deployment closely

## Success Criteria

### Immediate (First Deployment)
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline runs successfully
- [ ] Web deploys to Cloudflare Pages
- [ ] Backend deploys to Convex
- [ ] Installation folder properly handled
- [ ] No errors in deployment logs

### Short-term (First Week)
- [ ] Multiple deployments successful
- [ ] Rollback tested and working
- [ ] Monitoring alerts functioning
- [ ] Team comfortable with process
- [ ] Documentation proves useful

### Long-term (First Month)
- [ ] Zero-downtime deployments achieved
- [ ] Average deployment time < 5 minutes
- [ ] No production incidents from deployments
- [ ] Automated testing catches issues
- [ ] Team reports increased confidence

## Known Limitations

1. **Cloudflare Rollback:** No CLI support, must use dashboard
2. **Installation Folder:** Build-time baking requires rebuild for updates
3. **Testing:** Limited integration test coverage initially
4. **Monitoring:** No real-time alerts set up yet
5. **Convex Rollback:** Requires manual git checkout and redeploy

## Next Steps

### Immediate
1. Test all scripts locally
2. Set up GitHub Secrets
3. Run first test deployment to preview
4. Verify CI/CD pipeline works

### Short-term (This Week)
1. Create integration tests
2. Set up monitoring alerts
3. Test rollback procedures
4. Document incident response

### Medium-term (Next Month)
1. Implement KV/R2 for premium tier
2. Add multi-environment support
3. Create deployment dashboard
4. Automate rollback process

## Sign-off

**Verification Completed By:** agent-ops
**Date:** 2025-10-16
**Status:** âœ… Ready for Testing

**Recommended Next Action:** Test scripts locally, then set up GitHub Secrets for first CI/CD deployment.
