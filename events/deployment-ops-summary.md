# Deployment Automation Summary - Installation Folders

**Date:** 2025-10-16
**Agent:** agent-ops
**Status:** ✅ Complete

## Overview

Implemented comprehensive deployment automation and CI/CD infrastructure for installation folder multi-tenancy support across the ONE Platform.

## Deliverables

### 1. CI/CD Pipeline (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`)

**Features:**
- Automated testing on push/PR to main
- Multi-stage build (test → build → deploy)
- Installation folder detection and validation
- Parallel deployment to Cloudflare Pages and Convex
- Artifact management for build outputs

**Jobs:**
1. **test** - Run web + cli tests, type checking
2. **build-web** - Check for installation folder, build with environment variables
3. **deploy-cloudflare** - Deploy to Cloudflare Pages (main branch only)
4. **deploy-convex** - Deploy backend to Convex (main branch only)

**Environment Variables:**
- `INSTALLATION_NAME` - Installation folder identifier
- `PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL` - Backend URL
- `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` - Cloudflare authentication
- `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` - Account identifier
- `CONVEX_DEPLOY_KEY` - Convex deployment key

### 2. Deployment Scripts

#### `scripts/deploy-with-installation.sh`
**Purpose:** Full-stack deployment with installation folder support

**Process:**
1. Check for installation folder existence
2. Set environment variables (INSTALLATION_NAME, PUBLIC_INSTALLATION_NAME)
3. Build web application with bun
4. Deploy to Cloudflare Pages (project: web)
5. Deploy backend to Convex
6. Report deployment URLs

**Usage:**
```bash
./scripts/deploy-with-installation.sh [installation-name]
# Default: one-group
```

#### `scripts/backup-installation.sh`
**Purpose:** Backup installation folder with retention policy

**Features:**
- Creates timestamped tar.gz archives
- Stores backups in `backups/installations/`
- Keeps last 10 backups automatically
- Validates folder existence before backup

**Usage:**
```bash
./scripts/backup-installation.sh [installation-name]
```

#### `scripts/validate-deployment.sh`
**Purpose:** Pre-deployment validation checks

**Validations:**
1. Environment variables set (PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL)
2. Installation folder exists and has correct structure
3. Ontology directories present (groups, people, things, connections, events, knowledge)
4. All tests passing (web + cli)
5. TypeScript type checking passes
6. Test build succeeds

**Usage:**
```bash
./scripts/validate-deployment.sh
```

### 3. Wrangler Configuration Updates

**File:** `web/wrangler.toml`

**Added:**
- Production environment with custom domain (web.one.ie)
- Installation folder environment variables
- Preview environment configuration
- Environment-specific variable scoping

**Configuration:**
```toml
[env.production]
routes = [
  { pattern = "web.one.ie", custom_domain = true }
]

[env.production.vars]
INSTALLATION_NAME = "one-group"
PUBLIC_INSTALLATION_NAME = "one-group"
```

### 4. Package Scripts Updates

**File:** `web/package.json`

**Added Scripts:**
- `deploy` - Full deployment with installation folder
- `deploy:preview` - Deploy to preview branch
- `validate` - Run deployment validation

**Usage:**
```bash
bun run deploy         # Full deployment
bun run deploy:preview # Preview deployment
bun run validate       # Pre-deployment checks
```

### 5. Documentation

#### `one/events/deployment-installation-folders.md`
**Comprehensive deployment guide including:**
- Step-by-step deployment instructions
- Environment variable configuration
- CI/CD overview
- Manual deployment procedures
- Rollback strategies
- Monitoring and logging
- Troubleshooting guide
- Best practices

#### Updated `.claude/commands/release.md`
**Added:**
- Installation folder sync section
- Changelog template for installation folder features
- rsync command for syncing to assembly repo

## Architecture Decisions

### 1. Build-Time vs Runtime Resolution

**Decision:** Use build-time baking for MVP (Solution 1 from plan)

**Rationale:**
- Faster (no runtime lookups)
- Simple deployment
- Works with static generation
- Cloudflare Pages read-only filesystem compatible

**Trade-offs:**
- Requires rebuild for documentation updates
- Larger bundle size (acceptable for MVP)

**Future Enhancement:** Hybrid approach with KV/R2 for premium tier

### 2. Environment Variable Strategy

**Decision:** Use `INSTALLATION_NAME` and `PUBLIC_INSTALLATION_NAME`

**Rationale:**
- Clear separation between internal and public-facing names
- Aligns with Astro's `PUBLIC_*` convention
- Consistent with existing `PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL` pattern

### 3. CI/CD Trigger Strategy

**Decision:** Deploy only on push to main, test on all PRs

**Rationale:**
- Prevents accidental deployments from PRs
- Ensures all code is reviewed before deployment
- Maintains production stability

### 4. Backup Retention Policy

**Decision:** Keep last 10 backups automatically

**Rationale:**
- Balances storage usage with recovery options
- Covers ~10 deployments worth of history
- Automatic cleanup prevents manual maintenance

## Security Considerations

### 1. Path Traversal Prevention
- Installation name validation in scripts
- No `..` or absolute paths allowed
- Symlink validation (to be implemented in file resolver)

### 2. Secret Management
- All secrets in GitHub Secrets (not in code)
- No example credentials in documentation
- Environment variables scoped per environment

### 3. Access Control
- Deployment requires CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN
- Convex deployment requires CONVEX_DEPLOY_KEY
- GitHub Actions secrets properly scoped

### 4. Audit Logging
- All deployments logged via GitHub Actions
- Installation folder access tracked (to be implemented)
- Cloudflare Pages logs deployment history

## Testing Strategy

### Automated Testing
- **Unit Tests:** CLI + web test suites
- **Type Checking:** TypeScript via `astro check`
- **Build Validation:** Test build before deployment
- **CI/CD Testing:** GitHub Actions runs on every PR

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Installation folder detection works
- [ ] Environment variables properly set
- [ ] Build succeeds with installation folder
- [ ] Cloudflare deployment includes installation files
- [ ] Convex deployment succeeds
- [ ] Backup/restore works correctly
- [ ] Validation script catches errors

2. Add installation folder support to CLI init command
3. Create integration tests for deployment workflow
4. Set up production monitoring and alerts

### Medium-term (1-2 months)
1. Implement KV/R2 storage for premium customers (Solution 2/3)
2. Add multi-environment support (dev, staging, prod)
3. Create deployment dashboard
4. Implement automated rollback

### Long-term (3-6 months)
1. Blue-green deployment strategy
2. Canary releases with gradual rollout
3. Infrastructure as code
4. Automated performance benchmarking

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
1. **Modular scripts** - Each script has single responsibility
2. **Validation first** - Catch errors before deployment
3. **Clear documentation** - Comprehensive guides prevent confusion
4. **Environment variables** - Clean separation of concerns

### What Could Be Improved
1. **Rollback automation** - Currently manual (Cloudflare limitation)
2. **Testing coverage** - Need integration tests for full workflow
3. **Monitoring** - No real-time alerts yet
4. **Secrets management** - Could use more sophisticated solution

### Recommendations
1. Test deployment pipeline thoroughly before production use
2. Set up monitoring and alerting immediately
3. Document incident response procedures
4. Create runbooks for common failure scenarios
5. Regularly test backup/restore process
