## Feature 1: User Segment Integration on Homepage ✅

### What Was Built

Enhanced the ONE Platform homepage with comprehensive user segment showcasing, transforming the messaging from abstract AI/blockchain concepts to concrete website-building use cases.

### Changes Made

#### 1. New "Who ONE Is For?" Section
- **8 User Segment Cards:**
  - Kids 🧒 - Communities, Content, Safe
  - Young People 🧑‍💻 - Courses, Projects, Monetize
  - Creators 🧑‍🎨 - AI Clones, Tokens, Courses
  - Sellers 🛒 - Products, Sales Agents, Analytics
  - Marketers 📈 - Campaigns, Leads, Insights
  - Designers 🎨 - Templates, Assets, Branding
  - Engineers ⚙️ - Integrations, Workflows, APIs
  - Executives 🤵 - Analytics, Strategy, Insights

#### 2. Enhanced Sections Throughout Homepage
- **How It Works:** Added persona-specific inline examples
- **AI Agents:** Tagged each agent with relevant user segments
- **Code Examples:** Added persona badges to all examples
- **What You Can Build:** Persona-specific feature tags

### Impact

✅ **Immediate Relevance:** Visitors instantly see "this is for ME"
✅ **Multi-Persona Appeal:** One platform serves 8+ distinct audiences
✅ **Clear Value Props:** Specific benefits per segment
✅ **Reduced Cognitive Load:** Inline examples instead of walls of text

### Files Modified

- `web/src/pages/index.astro` - Complete homepage redesign
- Build: 0 errors, 0 warnings ✅

## Feature 2: Website-Building Examples Update ✅

### What Was Built

Transformed all examples across the site from AI/token focus to website-building focus, aligning with the platform's current strength in Astro site generation.

### Changes Made

#### 1. Homepage Examples (`index.astro`)
**Before:** AI clones, token purchases, chat features
**After:** Landing pages, blogs, documentation sites, e-commerce

- **Build a Landing Page:** Hero, pricing, CTA components
- **Add a Blog:** Content collections, search, tags
- **Create Documentation:** Sidebar nav, MDX, full-text search
- **Build E-commerce Store:** Products, Stripe, cart, inventory

#### 2. Ontology Page (`ontology.astro`)
**Before:** "Fan Buys Creator Tokens" example
**After:** "Build a Landing Page with Pricing" example

Updated all 6 dimensions:
- **Groups:** SaaS Startup organization scope
- **People:** Product owner authorizes build
- **Things:** astro_page, react_component entities
- **Connections:** page contains components
- **Events:** page_created, site_deployed
- **Knowledge:** framework:astro, lighthouse:100

#### 3. Language Page (`language.astro`)
**Before:** AI chat and token examples
**After:** Website creation examples

Updated all 15 Plain English DSL commands:
- CREATE → Create pages and components
- CONNECT → Connect pages to sites
- RECORD → Record page_created, site_deployed
- CALL → Call Astro to generate, Cloudflare to deploy

### Impact

✅ **Consistency:** All pages show website-building
✅ **Concrete Examples:** Landing pages, blogs, docs vs abstract AI
✅ **Framework-Specific:** Showcases Astro strengths
✅ **Immediate Value:** "I can build my website with this"
✅ **Ontology Proof:** Same 6 dimensions work for websites

### Files Modified

- `web/src/pages/index.astro`
- `web/src/pages/ontology.astro`
- `web/src/pages/language.astro`
- Build: 0 errors, 0 warnings ✅
