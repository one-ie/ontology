# CASCADE #2: Backend-Agnostic Frontend Architecture

**Status:** Structure Complete - Awaiting Specialist Execution
**Created:** 2025-10-13
**Priority:** High (Strategic Enhancement)
**Duration:** 4-6 weeks
**Team:** Backend Specialist, Frontend Specialist, Integration Specialist, Quality Agent, Design Agent

---

## CASCADE Overview

This document tracks the complete numbered CASCADE structure for Plan #2: Backend-Agnostic Frontend Architecture.

**Strategic Value:**
- Removes vendor lock-in (not tied to Convex)
- Enables multi-backend federation
- Supports organizations with existing infrastructure
- Proves ontology is truly protocol-agnostic
- Opens market to enterprises with backend requirements

---

## Ontology Validation Summary

### ✅ All 6 Dimensions Mapped

1. **Organizations** - Each org configures `properties.backendProvider`
2. **People** - Only `org_owner` role can configure backend providers
3. **Things** - New thing type: `external_connection` (backend configurations)
4. **Connections** - New relationship: `configured_by` (org → external_connection)
5. **Events** - New event: `provider_changed` (when backend swaps)
6. **Knowledge** - Labels tag backend provider capabilities

**Verdict:** ✅ PASS - All 6 dimensions successfully mapped

## Parallel Execution Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2)
**Can Run in Parallel:**
- Feature 2-1 (Week 1) - Backend Specialist
- Feature 2-2 (Week 1, after 2-1) - Backend Specialist
- Feature 2-3 (Week 2, after 2-1, 2-2) - Backend Specialist
- Feature 2-4 (Week 1-2, after 2-1) - Frontend Specialist

**Critical Path:** Feature 2-1 blocks all others

### Phase 2: Migration (Week 3-4)
**Must Run Sequentially (Risk Mitigation):**
- Feature 2-5 (Week 3) - Frontend Specialist (50+ auth tests MUST pass)
- Feature 2-6 (Week 4) - Frontend Specialist (after auth is stable)

### Phase 3: Expansion (Week 5-6)
**Sequential:**
- Feature 2-7 (Week 5-6) - Integration Specialist (proves flexibility)

---

## Rollback Strategy

### Rollback Points
1. **After Feature 2-1:** Revert to direct Convex hooks (easy)
2. **After Feature 2-5:** Keep auth on DataProvider, rollback dashboard (medium)
3. **After Feature 2-6:** Full rollback not possible (breaking change)

### Rollback Procedure
```bash
# 1. Revert to previous commit
git revert <feature_commit_range>

# 2. Re-enable ConvexClientProvider
# Edit: frontend/src/app.tsx

# 3. Restore direct Convex hook imports
# Edit: Affected component files

# 4. Run full test suite
cd frontend/
bun test
bunx astro check

# 5. Verify auth still works
bun test test/auth
```

**Rollback Time:** <5 minutes at each gate

---

## Risk Analysis

### Risk 1: Auth Tests Break During Migration
- **Probability:** High
- **Impact:** Critical
- **Mitigation:** Run auth test suite after EVERY component migration

### Risk 2: Performance Regression
- **Probability:** Medium
- **Impact:** High
- **Mitigation:** Benchmark current performance, target <10ms overhead

### Risk 3: TypeScript Errors Proliferate
- **Probability:** Medium
- **Impact:** Medium
- **Mitigation:** Strong interface types from day 1

### Risk 4: Context Budget Explosion
- **Probability:** Medium
- **Impact:** Medium
- **Mitigation:** Keep DataProvider interface minimal, use code generation

---

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- **Context Reduction:** 98% (150K → 3K tokens)
- **Code Reduction:** 30% fewer LOC (via abstraction)
- **Type Safety:** 100% typed (no `any` except entity properties)
- **Test Coverage:** 90%+ unit, 80%+ integration
- **Performance:** <10ms DataProvider overhead

### Strategic Metrics
- **Backend Flexibility:** 3+ providers supported (Convex, WordPress, Notion)
- **Organization Adoption:** Organizations can choose their backend
- **Developer Velocity:** 50% faster to add new providers
- **Migration Time:** 4-6 weeks (efficient execution)
- **Market Expansion:** Ready for enterprise customers
