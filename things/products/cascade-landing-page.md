# ONE Cascade Landing Page

> **Write in English. Deploy in Minutes. No Code Required.**

---

## Hero Section

### Headline

**Plain English → Production Code**
Build AI-native applications by describing what you want in simple English. No coding experience required.

### Subheadline

ONE Cascade transforms plain English descriptions into working applications through 8 specialized AI agents and 6 progressive stages. Powered by the ONE Ontology for 98% context reduction and automatic validation.

### CTA Buttons

- **Start Building Free** → [Sign Up]
- **Watch Demo** → [Video: 3-minute overview]
- **Read Docs** → [Documentation]

### Trust Indicators

- ✅ 98% faster than traditional development
- ✅ Automatic code validation
- ✅ Production-ready in 2-3 weeks
- ✅ No coding experience required

---

## Problem Section

### Traditional Development Is Broken

**For Non-Technical Founders:**

- 😫 Months to build MVP
- 💸 $100K+ development costs
- 🐛 Bugs discovered after launch
- 📚 Technical debt from day one
- 🤷 Dependency on developers

**For Developers:**

- 🔥 150,000+ tokens per AI request
- 💰 $$$$ context costs
- 🐌 Slow code generation
- 🔄 Manual coordination between agents
- 📝 Generic, unfocused responses

**The Core Problem:**
Traditional AI coding tools load your entire codebase into context—slow, expensive, and unfocused. You spend months translating ideas into technical specifications, then more months debugging implementations.

---

## Solution Section

### How CASCADE Works

**The Beautiful Truth:**
You already know how to describe what you want. Just write it in plain English.

```
FEATURE: Import my YouTube videos and create courses

GET my YouTube channel videos
FOR EACH video extract title and description
CREATE course with video as lesson
CONNECT me to course as owner
RECORD course created
SHOW my courses dashboard
```

**That's it. Seriously.**

CASCADE:

1. ✅ **Validates** every command against the ONE Ontology
2. 🎯 **Loads** only the context needed for your specific feature
3. 🚀 **Orchestrates** 8 specialized agents in parallel
4. 💻 **Generates** production-ready TypeScript code
5. ✅ **Tests** everything automatically
6. 🎨 **Designs** beautiful UI/UX
7. 📦 **Deploys** to the edge

**Result:** Working application in 2-3 weeks instead of 3-6 months.

## How It Works Section

### From English to Reality in 6 Stages

#### Stage 1: Ideas (Validation)

**You write:** Plain English commands
**CASCADE validates:** Against 66 entity types, 25 connection types, 67 event types
**Output:** Validated feature specification
**Context used:** 200 tokens (ontology type names only)

#### Stage 2: Plans (Organization)

**Director creates:** Feature assignments for specialists
**Groups:** Related commands by domain (backend, frontend, integration)
**Output:** Parallel task lists
**Context used:** 1,500 tokens (ontology types + similar patterns)

#### Stage 3: Features (Specifications)

**Specialists write:** Technical specifications in parallel
**Backend:** Converts `CREATE`, `RECORD`, `CALL` to services
**Frontend:** Converts `SHOW`, `GIVE` to UI components
**Integration:** Converts `CONNECT` to relationships
**Context used:** 1,500 tokens per agent (only their assigned types)

#### Stage 4: Tests (Quality)

**Quality agent defines:** Acceptance criteria from user flows
**Converts:** Plain English flows to test specifications
**Validates:** Every `CHECK`, `OTHERWISE` has corresponding test
**Context used:** 2,000 tokens (validation rules + test patterns)

#### Stage 5: Design (User Experience)

**Design agent creates:** UI that executes your flows
**Wireframes:** Visual representation of each command
**Components:** React components for each operation
**Context used:** 2,000 tokens (design patterns + components)

#### Stage 6: Implementation (Code Generation)

**Specialists generate:** Production code from specifications
**Includes:** Effect.ts services, Convex functions, React components, tests
**Validates:** Implementation matches DSL specification
**Context used:** 2,500 tokens (everything for THIS feature, nothing else)

### Context Engineering Magic

**Traditional AI Coding:**

```
Load entire codebase → 150,000 tokens → $$$$ per request → Slow generation
```

**CASCADE with Ontology:**

```
Load only what's needed → 3,000 tokens average → 98% cost reduction → Fast generation
```

**How?** The ONE Ontology acts as an index:

- Your commands reference specific entity types
- CASCADE loads ONLY those type definitions
- Agents work with focused, relevant context
- Parallel execution without coordination overhead

---

## Features Section

### What Makes CASCADE Different

#### 🎯 Ontology-Driven Validation

Every command is validated against the 6-dimension ontology BEFORE code generation. Catch errors at "compile time" instead of runtime.

**You write:** `CREATE xyz`
**CASCADE responds:** "Unknown entity type 'xyz'. Did you mean: ai_clone, course, token?"

#### 🚀 98% Context Reduction

Load only what's needed for each stage. Average 3,000 tokens vs 150,000 tokens for traditional AI coding.

**Result:** Faster generation, lower costs, more focused code.

#### ⚡ Automatic Parallelization

Independent commands execute concurrently. No manual coordination required.

**Example:**

```
FOR EACH video DO:
  - Extract transcript (parallel)
  - Generate thumbnail (parallel)
  - Calculate duration (parallel)
```

#### 🎨 Beautiful UI/UX

Design agent creates interfaces that match your user flows. Every operation has visual feedback.

#### ✅ Built-in Testing

Quality agent converts your flows to comprehensive test suites. Every edge case covered.

#### 🔄 Self-Healing Code

Problem Solver detects mismatches between specification and implementation, proposes fixes automatically.

#### 📚 Knowledge Accumulation

Lessons learned from every project become reusable patterns for future features.

#### 🎭 8 Specialized Agents

- **Director** - Validates & orchestrates
- **Backend Specialist** - Services & database
- **Frontend Specialist** - UI & components
- **Integration Specialist** - APIs & relationships
- **Quality Agent** - Tests & validation
- **Design Agent** - UI/UX & wireframes
- **Problem Solver** - Debug & fix
- **Documenter** - Docs & examples

## FAQ Section

### Frequently Asked Questions

#### Do I need coding experience?

**No.** CASCADE is designed for non-technical founders and creators. Write what you want in plain English and CASCADE handles the technical implementation.

#### How does CASCADE validate my commands?

Every command is checked against the **ONE Ontology** (66 entity types, 25 connection types, 67 event types). Invalid commands are caught immediately with helpful suggestions.

#### What's the 6-dimension ontology?

A proven data model that represents reality through: **Organizations** (scope), **People** (authorization), **Things** (entities), **Connections** (relationships), **Events** (actions), and **Knowledge** (context). Every feature maps to these dimensions.

#### Can I customize the generated code?

**Yes.** CASCADE generates clean, readable TypeScript that you can modify. The ontology ensures consistency even with custom changes.

#### What if I need a feature CASCADE doesn't support?

The **Problem Solver agent** can analyze gaps and propose solutions. Plus, the ontology is extensible—you can add custom entity types.

#### How does parallel execution work?

CASCADE analyzes your DSL to identify independent operations (e.g., `FOR EACH video` processes all videos concurrently). Automatic parallelization with no manual coordination.

#### What happens if implementation doesn't match my specification?

The **Quality Agent** runs tests and validates against your DSL. If mismatches are found, **Problem Solver** analyzes the gap and proposes fixes automatically.

#### Can CASCADE integrate with external APIs?

**Yes.** Use `CALL [service]` commands. Supported: OpenAI, Stripe, ElevenLabs, YouTube, and more. Custom integrations via service providers.

#### How do agents coordinate?

Agents communicate using **event-driven DSL**. Every `RECORD` command creates an event that other agents can watch. The events table IS the message bus.

#### Is there a learning curve?

**15 commands** cover 95% of use cases. Most users are productive within 30 minutes. The DSL reads like English—if you can write an email, you can use CASCADE.

#### What about scalability?

CASCADE generates code using **Effect.ts** (functional programming) and the **ONE Ontology** (proven to scale). Production-ready from day one.

#### Can I deploy anywhere?

CASCADE generates standard TypeScript. Deploy to Cloudflare, Vercel, AWS, or anywhere that supports Node.js and edge functions.
