```

---

```astro
<!-- For payment step -->
<CheckoutProgress currentStep="payment" />

<!-- For review step -->
<CheckoutProgress currentStep="review" />
```

**Add step navigation:**

<CheckoutProgress
  currentStep="payment"
  onStepClick={(step) => {

## Testing in Development

### Start Development Server

```bash
cd web/
bun run dev
```

### Test Free Shipping Progress

1. Navigate to `/ecommerce/cart`
2. Open browser console
3. Add items to cart (see progress update)
4. Watch progress bar fill as subtotal increases
5. See green checkmark when subtotal >= $50

### Test Exit Intent Popup

1. Navigate to `/ecommerce/cart`
2. Move mouse to top of browser window (Y position < 10px)
3. Modal should appear with discount offer
4. Fill in email and submit
5. Check browser console for "FIRST10" in localStorage
6. Refresh page and try again - should NOT show (one-time per session)

### Test Checkout Progress

1. Navigate to `/ecommerce/checkout`
2. See 3-step progress indicator below title
3. Current step (Shipping) should be highlighted
4. Future steps should be grayed out

### Test Trust Badges

1. Navigate to `/ecommerce/checkout`
2. Scroll to order summary sidebar
3. See payment method icons at bottom
4. Hover over icons - should change from grayscale to color
5. See security badges in 2x2 grid

## Integration with Real Data

### Connect to Cart Store

All components automatically connect to the cart store at `/src/stores/cart.ts`:

```typescript
import { $cartSubtotal } from '@/stores/cart';
```

No additional configuration needed - components are reactive to cart changes.

---

### Apply Discount Code at Checkout

The exit intent popup stores the discount code in localStorage. To apply it at checkout:

```typescript
// In checkout form component
const discountCode = localStorage.getItem('discount-code');
if (discountCode === 'FIRST10') {
  // Apply 10% discount
  const discount = subtotal * 0.1;
  const total = subtotal - discount;
}
```

---

### Track Checkout Step

To sync checkout progress with form state:

```typescript
// In checkout form component
const [currentStep, setCurrentStep] = useState<CheckoutStep>('shipping');

// Update step on form progression
const handleNext = () => {
  if (currentStep === 'shipping') setCurrentStep('payment');
  if (currentStep === 'payment') setCurrentStep('review');
};

// Pass to CheckoutProgress component
<CheckoutProgress
  currentStep={currentStep}
  onStepClick={setCurrentStep}
/>
```

---

## Performance Considerations

### Bundle Size
- **Total Added:** ~17KB gzipped
- **Interactive Components:** 11KB (FreeShippingProgress + ExitIntentPopup)
- **Static Components:** 6KB (CheckoutProgress + TrustBadges)

### Hydration Strategy
- Only 2 components use `client:load` (FreeShippingProgress, ExitIntentPopup)
- Static components have zero JavaScript cost
- No layout shift (components render with proper sizing)

### Optimization Tips
1. Use `client:visible` instead of `client:load` for below-fold components
2. Lazy load exit intent popup (only load after 5 seconds on page)
3. Preload payment method SVGs for faster rendering

---

## Troubleshooting

### Progress Bar Not Updating

**Issue:** Free shipping progress bar stuck at 0%

**Solution:**
- Check that cart store is properly imported
- Verify items are being added to cart correctly
- Check browser console for errors

---

### Exit Intent Not Triggering

**Issue:** Modal doesn't appear when moving mouse to top

**Solution:**
- Check sessionStorage - clear 'exit-intent-shown' key
- Verify mouse position detection (should be Y <= 10px)
- Check browser console for errors
- Try in incognito mode (fresh session)

---

### Checkout Progress Not Showing

**Issue:** Progress indicator missing on checkout page

**Solution:**
- Verify component is imported correctly
- Check `currentStep` prop is valid: 'shipping', 'payment', or 'review'
- Ensure component is not hidden by CSS

---

### Trust Badges Not Hoverable

**Issue:** Icons stay grayscale on hover

**Solution:**
- Check Tailwind classes are applied
- Verify `group` and `group-hover:grayscale-0` classes present
- Clear browser cache and rebuild

---
