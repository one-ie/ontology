## HANDOFF PROTOCOL

### When Specialist A Finishes, Specialist B Takes Over

**Example: Backend schema â†’ Frontend components**

1. **agent-backend completes schema** (Day 5 EOD)
   - Posts: "Schema frozen, ready for frontend"
   - Tags: @agent-frontend
   - Attachment: schema.ts + spec doc

2. **agent-frontend reads spec** (Day 6 9 AM)
   - Reviews: What things exist? What fields matter?
   - Questions: Post clarifications in #questions
   - Confirms: "Got it, starting component design"

3. **agent-frontend implements components** (Day 6-8)
   - Uses schema to type components
   - Posts daily progress in standup
   - Any schema changes? Negotiated with agent-backend

4. **agent-quality writes tests for schema** (Day 5 EOD)
   - While frontend implements components
   - Tests DB operations (read, write, update, delete)
   - Posts: "Schema tests passing"

## IF TIMELINE SLIPS

### Option 1: Reduce Scope (Recommended)
- Remove todo-skills, todo-sell from v1.0
- Focus: onboard â†’ x402 â†’ ecommerce â†’ chat â†’ api â†’ launch
- Redeploy skills/sell in v1.1 (2 weeks after launch)
- Impact: Faster launch, safer

### Option 2: Add Specialist
- Bring in 7th specialist (contractor)
- Focus on QA (reduce burden on agent-quality)
- Impact: +25% capacity, +15% cost
