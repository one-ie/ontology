## PHASE 1: FOUNDATION & SETUP (Infer 1-10)

**Purpose:** Validate e-commerce requirements, map to ontology, plan implementation

### Infer 1: Define Product Types

- [ ] **Courses:** Video lessons bundled (monthly/one-time)

- [ ] **Memberships:** Tiered access + recurring revenue (monthly/yearly)
- [ ] **1:1 Consultations:** Personal sessions with creator (booked + paid)
- [ ] **NFTs:** Digital collectibles (one-time, blockchain)
- [ ] **API Access:** Agent/workflow execution (pay-per-use via X402)
- [ ] **Custom Services:** Bespoke products defined by creator
- [ ] For each type, define:
  - [ ] Pricing model
  - [ ] Delivery method
  - [ ] Refund policy
  - [ ] Digital vs physical

### Infer 2: Map E-Commerce to 6-Dimension Ontology

- [ ] **Groups:** Creator's business group
- [ ] **People:** Creator (seller), customer (buyer), platform (facilitator)
- [ ] **Things:** product, shopping_cart, order, payment, subscription
- [ ] **Connections:**
  - [ ] creator → product (owns)
  - [ ] customer → product (purchased)
  - [ ] customer → subscription (subscribed_to)
  - [ ] product → payment (transacted)
- [ ] **Events:**
  - [ ] product_created, product_updated, product_deleted
  - [ ] cart_created, item_added, item_removed
  - [ ] checkout_initiated, payment_processed, order_completed
  - [ ] subscription_started, subscription_renewed, subscription_cancelled
- [ ] **Knowledge:** product_category, price_tier, access_level labels

### Infer 3: Review X402 Integration (from todo-x402)

- [ ] Understand X402 payment flow (402 → payment → settled)
- [ ] Identify how X402 applies to checkout:
  - [ ] Primary: Crypto payments (USDC on Base)
  - [ ] Support: Traditional (Stripe) as fallback (future)
- [ ] Plan X402 as default payment for digital products
- [ ] Plan traditional payment for higher-value items (consultations)
- [ ] Map payment to events: payment_processed → order_completed

### Infer 4: Define Shopping Cart Requirements

- [ ] Cart functionality:

  - [ ] Minimum $5 threshold before payout
- [ ] Events:
