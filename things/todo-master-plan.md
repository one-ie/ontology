## 💡 THE INFERENCE-BASED PLANNING PARADIGM

**Key Innovation:** Instead of time-based planning ("Day 1-3", "Week 2"), we use **sequence-based planning (100 inferences per feature)**

### Why This Works

1. **Precision:** Each inference is concrete + measurable
2. **Context-Light:** Each specialist reads ~3-5KB per inference (not full codebase)
3. **Parallel-Friendly:** Multiple specialists execute simultaneously
4. **Dependency-Aware:** Critical path identified, blocker-free
5. **Release-Ready:** Every phase is releasable
6. **Quality-Default:** Testing concurrent with dev, not deferred

### The Pattern (Consistent Across All 9 Files)

Each todo file has 10 phases, 100 inferences:

- **Phase 1 (Infer 1-10):** Foundation & setup
- **Phase 2 (Infer 11-20):** Backend schema & services
- **Phase 3 (Infer 21-30):** Frontend components & pages
- **Phase 4 (Infer 31-40):** API routes & integration
- **Phase 5 (Infer 41-50):** Payments/blockchain/core mechanics
- **Phase 6 (Infer 51-60):** Quality & testing
- **Phase 7 (Infer 61-70):** Design & wireframes
- **Phase 8 (Infer 71-80):** Performance & optimization
- **Phase 9 (Infer 81-90):** Deployment & documentation
- **Phase 10 (Infer 91-100):** Knowledge & lessons learned

This structure repeats for every feature, enabling:

- Easy scaling (add more files, same pattern)
- Consistency (all specialists know phases)
- Parallelization (multiple specialists, multiple files)
- Quality gates (testing in Phase 6 + 8 + 9)

## 🔄 6 SPECIALIST AGENTS + WORKLOAD

From `/claude/plans/specialist-assignments.md`:

| Specialist           | Primary Role            | Workload    | Key Files                            |
| -------------------- | ----------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **agent-backend**    | Database + server logic | ~320 infers | onboard, ecommerce, api, sell        |
| **agent-frontend**   | React + Astro UI        | ~250 infers | onboard, ecommerce, one-ie, features |
| **agent-integrator** | External systems        | ~270 infers | x402, agents, sell, api              |
| **agent-builder**    | Agent framework         | ~200 infers | agents, skills, builder              |
| **agent-quality**    | Testing + validation    | ~150 infers | all (concurrent testing)             |
| **agent-designer**   | UI/UX + accessibility   | ~110 infers | one-ie, ecommerce (design tokens)    |
| **agent-ops**        | DevOps + deployment     | ~? infers   | template, releases                   |

**Coordination Model:**

- **Daily:** 15-min standup (what's blocking, need help)
- **Weekly:** 1hr sync (wave planning, dependencies)
- **Per-Wave:** Kickoff + retrospective
- **Escalation:** Director arbitrates conflicts

## 📊 KEY METRICS AT COMPLETION

When all 900 inferences are executed:

| Metric                   | Target                                |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| **Total Inferences**     | 900 (9 × 100)                         |
| **Test Coverage**        | 80%+ across platform                  |
| **Code Commits**         | 200+ (git history)                    |
| **Documents**            | 50+ (planning + docs)                 |
| **Features Shipped**     | 40+ (across all areas)                |
| **First Creators**       | 100+ registered                       |
| **First Revenue**        | $1000+ processed                      |
| **Deployment Frequency** | Weekly releases (v1.1-v2.0)           |
| **Time to v2.0.0**       | 8 weeks from start                    |
| **Team Efficiency**      | 100-112 infers per specialist per day |

## 🚀 NEXT IMMEDIATE ACTIONS

### This Week

1. **Review Planning Documents** (30 min)
   - Read `/claude/plans/README.md` (quick start)
   - Scan execution summary + master plan

2. **Brief Specialist Agents** (1 hour)
   - Share assignments from `specialist-assignments.md`
   - Clarify roles + dependencies
   - Answer initial questions

3. **Prepare Wave 1** (2 hours)
   - Review todo-onboard.md
   - Create GitHub issues (1 per phase)
   - Set up dev environment
   - Schedule Wave 1 kickoff

4. **Create 5 Remaining Todo Files** (parallel)
   - Specialists can start creating simultaneously:
     - agent-integrator → todo-agents.md
     - agent-builder → todo-skills.md
     - agent-backend + agent-integrator → todo-sell.md
     - agent-backend → todo-api.md
     - agent-frontend + agent-quality → todo-features.md

### Week 1-2 (Wave 1 Execution)

- **agent-backend** starts on todo-onboard.md Phase 2 (schema)
- **agent-frontend** starts on todo-onboard.md Phase 3 (components)
- **agent-quality** starts on todo-onboard.md Phase 6 (testing)
- All in parallel, daily standups

### After Wave 1 Complete (Week 2 End)

- Release v1.1.0 (X402 + onboarding)
- Start Wave 2 (agents, skills, sell) in parallel
- Continue Wave 1 testing + bug fixes

---

## 🎓 KEY PRINCIPLES FOR SUCCESS

### 1. **Plan in Inferences, Not Days**

- Ask "where does this belong in the sequence?" not "how long will it take?"
- Each inference = concrete step forward
- Medium-sized inferences = 30-120 minutes of work

### 2. **Execute in Parallel**

- Never wait for other specialists
- Identify dependencies upfront
- Use interfaces/contracts between modules
- Wave-based coordination (not per-task)

### 3. **Test Concurrent with Development**

- Phase 6 is testing, but test in Phases 2-4 too
- Don't defer quality
- 80%+ coverage = minimum standard
- Performance testing in Phase 8 (not last-minute)

### 4. **Release Early, Release Often**

- Every 2 weeks: v1.1, v1.2, v1.3, v1.4 → v2.0
- Each release ships a complete vertical (onboarding, agents, ecommerce, etc)
- Users see progress + give feedback
- Momentum maintained

### 5. **Document as You Go**

- Phase 9 is documentation, but write as you code
- Comments in code
- Inline examples
- Lessons learned in Phase 10
- Knowledge captured immediately

---

## 📖 STRATEGIC ADVANTAGES OF THIS APPROACH

✅ **Eliminates Ambiguity**

- Each inference is specific, measurable, achievable
- No "vague" work items
- Clear definition of "done"

✅ **Enables Parallelization**

- 6 specialists work simultaneously
- No sequential bottlenecks
- Wave-based synchronization (not daily)

✅ **Maintains Quality**

- Testing integrated, not deferred
- Performance measured early
- Accessibility built-in (Phase 7)

✅ **Achieves Velocity**

- Consistent pace: 100-112 inferences per specialist per day
- Predictable timeline: 8 weeks to public launch
- Release cadence: v1.1, v1.2, v1.3, v1.4, v2.0

✅ **Captures Knowledge**

- Every inference documented
- Lessons learned in Phase 10
- Becomes training material for future features

✅ **Scales Infinitely**

- Add feature? Create new 100-inference todo file
- Same pattern repeats
- New specialists learn quickly

## 🚀 LET'S BUILD

**Current Status:** 4/9 todo files complete | 400/900 inferences documented | Ready for parallel execution

**Next Step:** Create 5 remaining todo files in parallel (recommended):

1. **TODAY:** agent-integrator creates todo-agents.md
2. **TODAY:** agent-builder creates todo-skills.md
3. **TODAY:** agent-backend creates todo-sell.md + todo-api.md
4. **TODAY:** agent-frontend creates todo-features.md
5. **TOMORROW:** Adjust + coordinate + start Wave 1

**Then:** Execute 900 inferences → v2.0.0 public launch in 8 weeks

---

## 💬 FINAL THOUGHTS

We have now:

- ✅ Created comprehensive master orchestration plan
- ✅ Identified 6 specialist agents + their roles
- ✅ Mapped 900 inferences across 9 vertical features
- ✅ Planned 4-wave execution + 5-release schedule
- ✅ Documented strategic principles + success metrics
- ✅ Built 4 foundational todo files (x402, onboard, ecommerce, one-ie)

The remaining work is **execution at scale**: 5 more todo files in parallel, then 900 inferences of focused, high-velocity development.

**This is the blueprint for ONE Platform's path to v2.0.0 public launch. Let's execute it with precision, velocity, and quality.**
