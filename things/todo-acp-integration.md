# ONE Platform: ACP (Agent Communication Protocol) Integration v1.0.0

**Focus:** Enable agents to discover, communicate, and collaborate via ACP standard
**Process:** `Infer 1-100 inference sequence`
**Timeline:** 8-12 inferences per specialist per day
**Target:** Foundation for multi-agent orchestration (Wave 2 - CRITICAL PATH EXTENSION)
**Spec:** https://agentcommunicationprotocol.dev/

---

## CRITICAL CONTEXT

ACP is the **lingua franca** for inter-agent communication. Integration enables:

1. **Agent Discovery:** Find agents by capability (image gen, text analysis, payment processing)
2. **Agent Communication:** Send sync/async messages between agents
3. **Task Delegation:** One agent assigns work to another (e.g., content creator agent → payment processor agent)
4. **Multi-Agent Workflows:** Chain agents together (user request → analysis agent → recommendation agent → checkout agent)
5. **Marketplace Effects:** Agents can offer services to other agents (monetized)

**This is how agents become an economy.**

---

## PHASE 1: FOUNDATION & SETUP (Infer 1-10)

**Purpose:** Understand ACP, map to ONE ontology, plan integration

### Infer 1: Understand ACP Protocol Deeply

- [ ] Read ACP spec: https://agentcommunicationprotocol.dev/
- [ ] Key concepts:
  - [ ] REST-based (not proprietary)
  - [ ] Framework agnostic (Python, TypeScript, Go, etc)
  - [ ] Multimodal (text, images, audio, video, binary)
  - [ ] Sync mode: Request → immediate response
  - [ ] Async mode: Task → callback when done
  - [ ] Streaming: Real-time data chunks
  - [ ] Discovery: Find agents by capability
- [ ] Core endpoints:
  - [ ] POST /agents/{id}/messages (send message)
  - [ ] GET /agents/{id}/messages (inbox)
  - [ ] POST /agents/{id}/tasks (assign task)
  - [ ] GET /agents/{id}/tasks/{tid} (status)
  - [ ] GET /agents/{id}/capabilities (what can it do?)
  - [ ] GET /agents (discover agents)

### Infer 2: Map ACP to 6-Dimension Ontology

- [ ] **Groups:** Agent network (group of agents that can communicate)
- [ ] **People:** Agent metadata (provider, version, support contact)
- [ ] **Things:**
  - [ ] agent (new thing type with ACP endpoint)
  - [ ] acp_message (sent/received between agents)
  - [ ] acp_task (delegated work)
  - [ ] acp_capability (what agent can do)
  - [ ] acp_service_offering (agent offers service)
- [ ] **Connections:**
  - [ ] agent → agent: `communicates_via_acp`
  - [ ] agent → capability: `has_capability`
  - [ ] agent → service: `offers_service`
  - [ ] task → agent: `assigned_to`
  - [ ] message → agent: `routed_to`
- [ ] **Events:**
  - [ ] acp_message_sent
  - [ ] acp_message_received
  - [ ] acp_task_created
  - [ ] acp_task_started
  - [ ] acp_task_completed
  - [ ] acp_task_failed
  - [ ] agent_discovery_queried
  - [ ] agent_status_changed
- [ ] **Knowledge:**
  - [ ] agent_capability (labels: "image_generation", "payment_processing")
  - [ ] agent_embedding (for semantic capability search)
  - [ ] agent_performance (rating, reliability, speed)

### Infer 3: Define ACP Integration Scope

- [ ] **MVP (this todo file):**
  - [ ] ACP server implementation in /web + /backend
  - [ ] Agent registry (discover agents)
  - [ ] Message routing (sync messages)
  - [ ] Task delegation (async work)
  - [ ] Basic capability matching
  - [ ] Integration with todo-buy-chatgpt (chat agent)
  - [ ] Integration with todo-agents (agent deployment)
- [ ] **Extensions (future):**
  - [ ] Streaming support (real-time responses)
  - [ ] Agent coalitions (temp groups of agents)
  - [ ] Payment settlement between agents
  - [ ] Reputation/rating system
  - [ ] Advanced scheduling (cron-like tasks)
  - [ ] Rollback/retry logic
  - [ ] Multi-agent conversation (3+ agents)

### Infer 4: Identify Integration Points

- [ ] **Chat agent** (from todo-buy-chatgpt):
  - [ ] Can delegate recommendations to expert agents
  - [ ] Example: "Padel expert agent" → recommends products
  - [ ] Example: "Payment agent" → processes checkout
  - [ ] Example: "Analytics agent" → tracks metrics
- [ ] **Marketplace creators:**
  - [ ] Creator publishes "product description agent"
  - [ ] Other agents can call it for detailed info
  - [ ] Creator earns per API call
- [ ] **Workflow automation:**
  - [ ] N8N agent triggers multiple ONE agents
  - [ ] Example: "New product" → Content agent + Recommendation agent + Email agent
- [ ] **Multi-creator collaboration:**
  - [ ] Agent from creator A talks to agent from creator B
  - [ ] Share customer insights, co-create products
- [ ] **Payment processing:**
  - [ ] Any agent can request payment from chat via ACP
  - [ ] Payment agent settles transaction (X402)
  - [ ] Revenue flows to service provider (creator)

### Infer 5: Define Agent Types on ONE Platform

- [ ] **System Agents** (built by ONE):
  - [ ] Chat advisor agent (conversational commerce)
  - [ ] Product search agent (semantic search)
  - [ ] Payment processor agent (X402 settlement)
  - [ ] Analytics agent (metrics + insights)
  - [ ] Email agent (transactional emails)
  - [ ] Image generation agent (DALL-E, Stable Diffusion)
  - [ ] Content moderation agent (safety checks)
- [ ] **Creator Agents** (built by marketplace creators):
  - [ ] Domain expert agents (padel racket advisor, yoga instructor, etc)
  - [ ] Content generation agents (write blog posts, product descriptions)
  - [ ] Sales agents (upsell, retention)
  - [ ] Support agents (customer service)
  - [ ] Data analysis agents (understand customer behavior)
- [ ] **External Agents** (from partner platforms):
  - [ ] ElizaOS agents
  - [ ] AutoGen agents
  - [ ] LangChain agents
  - [ ] n8n workflows
- [ ] **Hybrid Agents** (human + AI):
  - [ ] Human reviews AI recommendation before publishing
  - [ ] Human approves large transactions
  - [ ] Human escalation for complex issues

### Infer 6: Plan Agent Registry

- [ ] Central registry of all agents:
  - [ ] Endpoint URL
  - [ ] Capabilities (what it can do)
  - [ ] Status (online, offline, busy)
  - [ ] Metadata (version, provider, pricing)
  - [ ] Performance metrics (uptime, avg response time, success rate)
  - [ ] Rating (user satisfaction)
  - [ ] Cost (if agent charges)
- [ ] Discovery methods:
  - [ ] Online: Query /agents?capability=image_generation
  - [ ] Offline: Agent registry stored in Convex (fallback)
  - [ ] Semantic: Find agents by meaning ("product advisor" ≈ "shopping expert")
- [ ] Registry features:
  - [ ] Auto-register on first message (or manual registration)
  - [ ] Health checks (ping agents every 5 minutes)
  - [ ] Auto-remove if offline > 1 hour
  - [ ] Rate limiting per agent (prevent abuse)
  - [ ] Reputation scoring (track success/failure)

### Infer 7: Define Message Routing

- [ ] How messages get from Agent A → Agent B:
  1. Agent A sends POST to ONE /api/acp/agents/agent-b/messages
  2. ONE validates message (authentication, format)
  3. ONE logs message to events table
  4. ONE routes message to Agent B's endpoint
  5. Agent B processes and returns response
  6. ONE logs response
  7. ONE returns to Agent A
- [ ] Capabilities:
  - [ ] Sync (immediate response)
  - [ ] Async (callback URL)
  - [ ] Streaming (chunks over time)
  - [ ] Broadcast (to multiple agents)
- [ ] Reliability:
  - [ ] Retry logic (3 attempts with exponential backoff)
  - [ ] Timeout handling (default 30s)
  - [ ] Dead letter queue (failed messages stored)
  - [ ] Message idempotency (same message twice = same result)

### Infer 8: Plan Task Delegation

- [ ] Task = async work assigned to agent
- [ ] Lifecycle:
  1. Agent A creates task: POST /agents/agent-b/tasks
  2. Agent B accepts immediately (returns taskId)
  3. Agent B works on task in background
  4. Agent B completes task
  5. Agent B calls callback URL (Agent A is notified)
  6. Agent A retrieves result: GET /agents/agent-b/tasks/{taskId}
- [ ] Task properties:
  - [ ] Type: What kind of work? (e.g., "analyze_dataset")
  - [ ] Parameters: Input data
  - [ ] Priority: Low, medium, high, critical
  - [ ] Timeout: Max time to complete
  - [ ] Callback: Where to send result
  - [ ] Streaming: Send chunks in real-time?
- [ ] Execution:
  - [ ] Queue system (process tasks in order)
  - [ ] Monitoring (track progress)
  - [ ] Timeout enforcement (kill if exceeds deadline)
  - [ ] Error handling (retry or fail gracefully)

### Infer 9: Define Security & Authentication

- [ ] Authentication:
  - [ ] API keys (simple: one per agent)
  - [ ] JWT tokens (scalable: signed tokens)
  - [ ] OAuth2 (enterprise: federated identity)
  - [ ] mTLS (advanced: mutual certificate verification)
- [ ] Authorization:
  - [ ] Which agents can talk to which agents?
  - [ ] Default: All agents can talk (open network)
  - [ ] Optional: Allow-lists for private networks
  - [ ] Role-based: System agents vs creator agents
- [ ] Privacy:
  - [ ] End-to-end encryption (TLS)
  - [ ] Message logging (who said what, when)
  - [ ] Data retention (archive old messages)
  - [ ] PII handling (don't log customer data)
- [ ] Abuse prevention:
  - [ ] Rate limiting (max messages per minute)
  - [ ] Spam detection (identical messages flagged)
  - [ ] Timeout enforcement (prevent infinite loops)
  - [ ] Resource limits (max message size, task timeout)

### Infer 10: Define Success Metrics

- [ ] ACP integration complete when:
  - [ ] [ ] ACP server endpoint live (/api/acp/\*)
  - [ ] [ ] Agent can register + discovery works
  - [ ] [ ] Message routing functional (sync + async)
  - [ ] [ ] Task delegation working
  - [ ] [ ] Agent registry searchable
  - [ ] [ ] First 5 agents successfully communicating
  - [ ] [ ] Chat agent delegates to expert agents
  - [ ] [ ] Payment flows between agents
  - [ ] [ ] Full audit trail (all ACP events logged)
  - [ ] [ ] 99.9% message delivery rate
  - [ ] [ ] < 500ms average message latency
  - [ ] [ ] Dashboard shows agent health + metrics

    - [ ] successRate
- [ ] New connection type: `communicates_via_acp`
  - [ ] Agent → Agent (when they've communicated)
  - [ ] Metadata:
    - [ ] lastCommunication
    - [ ] totalMessages
    - [ ] successRate

### Infer 15: Create ACP Service (Effect.ts)

- [ ] Service: `backend/convex/services/acp.ts`
- [ ] Methods:
  - [ ] `registerAgent(agentId, endpoint, capabilities)` → registered
  - [ ] `sendMessage(from, to, message, mode)` → messageId
  - [ ] `createTask(from, to, task, callback)` → taskId
  - [ ] `getTaskStatus(taskId)` → status + result
  - [ ] `discoverAgents(capability)` → agents[]
  - [ ] `getAgentCapabilities(agentId)` → capabilities
  - [ ] `routeMessage(messageId)` → forwarded to agent
  - [ ] `handleTaskCallback(taskId, result)` → stored
  - [ ] `healthCheckAgents()` → mark online/offline
  - [ ] `logACPEvent(type, data)` → event recorded

### Infer 16: Implement Message Routing

- [ ] Algorithm:
  1. Receive message for Agent B
  2. Validate sender (Agent A authenticated?)
  3. Validate recipient (Agent B exists + online?)
  4. Store message in Convex
  5. Log outbound event
  6. Call Agent B's endpoint (POST /agents/agent-b/messages)
  7. Agent B responds
  8. Log delivered event
  9. If async: Store callback URL, return immediately
  10. If sync: Return response to Agent A
- [ ] Error handling:
  - [ ] Agent offline → Queue message, retry later
  - [ ] Network error → Retry with backoff
  - [ ] Timeout → Return error to sender
  - [ ] Invalid format → Reject with error

### Infer 17: Implement Agent Discovery

- [ ] Endpoints:
  - [ ] `GET /api/acp/agents` - List all agents
  - [ ] `GET /api/acp/agents?capability=image_generation` - Filter by capability
  - [ ] `GET /api/acp/agents?status=online` - Filter by status
  - [ ] `GET /api/acp/agents/search?q=recommendation` - Full-text search
- [ ] Discovery algorithm:
  1. Query agents table with filters
  2. Filter by capability (exact match)
  3. Filter by status (only online unless specified)
  4. Sort by rating (highest first)
  5. Paginate results (20 per page)
  6. Return with metadata
- [ ] Caching:
  - [ ] Cache agent list (1 minute)
  - [ ] Invalidate on agent registration/deletion
  - [ ] Use Redis for speed

### Infer 18: Implement Task Queue

- [ ] Queue system for async tasks:
  - [ ] Tasks table ordered by priority + created time
  - [ ] Worker process pulls tasks from queue
  - [ ] Executes task on assigned agent
  - [ ] Waits for completion or timeout
  - [ ] Sends callback to requester
  - [ ] Updates task status
- [ ] Scalability:
  - [ ] Multiple workers (one per CPU core)
  - [ ] Distributed queue (if needed later)
  - [ ] Dead letter queue (failed tasks)
- [ ] Monitoring:
  - [ ] Queue depth (how many waiting?)
  - [ ] Processing rate (tasks per minute)
  - [ ] Average latency

### Infer 19: Implement Health Checks

- [ ] Background job (every 5 minutes):
  - [ ] Ping all registered agents
  - [ ] POST /agents/{id}/capabilities (lightweight)
  - [ ] Mark online if responds in < 5 seconds
  - [ ] Mark offline if no response
  - [ ] Update last_seen timestamp
  - [ ] Decrease uptime score if offline
  - [ ] Remove if offline > 1 hour
- [ ] Health check strategy:
  - [ ] Lightweight ping (fast)
  - [ ] Exponential backoff (don't spam offline agents)
  - [ ] Parallel pings (don't block on one agent)

### Infer 20: Create Convex Queries for ACP

- [ ] `queries/acp.ts`:
  - [ ] `getAgent(agentId)` → agent details
  - [ ] `getAgentsByCapability(capability)` → agents[]
  - [ ] `searchAgents(query)` → semantic search
  - [ ] `getAgentMessages(agentId)` → inbox
  - [ ] `getTaskStatus(taskId)` → status + result
  - [ ] `getConversation(correlationId)` → all related messages
  - [ ] `getAgentMetrics(agentId)` → performance stats
  - [ ] `getSystemMetrics()` → overall health
