# ONE Platform: Landing Page & Project Onboarding v1.0.0

**Focus:** Entry point for new creators - "Start a Project" instead of "Pick a Template"
**Process:** `Infer 1-100 inference sequence`
**Timeline:** 8-12 inferences per specialist per day
**Target:** Zero-friction creator onboarding (Wave 0 - ENTRY POINT)
**Integration:** Works with todo-onboard, todo-agents (via agent-clone)

---

## CRITICAL CONTEXT

**Current Problem:**
- Generic landing page ("Pick a template") doesn't guide creators
- Creators don't know where to start
- Templates are isolated (no context)

**Solution:**
- **"Start a Project"** workflow (not templates)
- **AI landing page generation** (paste URL/social → AI builds landing page)
- **Live demos** (see working examples before starting)
- **Guided paths** (beginner vs advanced)
- **Agent-powered** (agent-clone asks for context, generates content)

**User Journey:**
```
Land on one.ie
    ↓
See featured creators + demo projects
    ↓
Click "Start a Project"
    ↓
Choose: Beginner (simple project) or Advanced (dashboard)
    ↓
Beginner: "I have a URL" → Paste → AI generates landing page + product listings
Advanced: "I want a dashboard" → Linked to live demo
    ↓
Create account
    ↓
Onboarding guides them
    ↓
First creator ready to earn
```

## PHASE 1: FOUNDATION & SETUP (Infer 1-10)

**Purpose:** Understand entry point landscape, map to ontology, plan implementation

### Infer 1: Define "Start a Project" Concept
- [ ] Not "Pick a Template" - too generic
- [ ] Is "Start a Project" - guided journey
- [ ] Three paths for users:
  1. **Beginner Path:** "I have a website/social"
     - Paste URL or social profile
     - AI extracts info (who they are, what they do)
     - Generate landing page + product listings
     - Easy setup, fast to sell
  2. **Intermediate Path:** "I want to sell courses"
     - Product creation workflow
     - Course structure (modules, lessons)
     - Student dashboard
     - Certificate generation
  3. **Advanced Path:** "I want a full dashboard"
     - Creator analytics
     - Team management
     - Custom branding
     - API access
- [ ] Each path shows a DEMO before committing
  - [ ] Beginner demo: Working course site (like One.ie itself)
  - [ ] Intermediate demo: Padel course example
  - [ ] Advanced demo: Creator dashboard with metrics

### Infer 2: Map to 6-Dimension Ontology
- [ ] **Groups:** Creator's project (group as container)
- [ ] **People:**
  - [ ] Creator (initiates project)
  - [ ] AI agent-clone (generates content)
  - [ ] Platform admin (approves if needed)
- [ ] **Things:**
  - [ ] project (new thing type)
  - [ ] project_template (starter projects)
  - [ ] landing_page (generated or custom)
  - [ ] project_demo (working example)
- [ ] **Connections:**
  - [ ] creator → project (owns)
  - [ ] project → template (based_on)
  - [ ] project → demo (showcases)
  - [ ] agent-clone → project (generated)
- [ ] **Events:**
  - [ ] project_created
  - [ ] landing_page_generated
  - [ ] demo_viewed

  3. Agent-clone calls:
     - [ ] WebFetch to read URL content

  5. Claude generates landing page in THEIR voice
  6. Result: Landing page feels authentic, not generic

- [ ] **Step 3: Input**
  - [ ] If URL: Paste and submit
  - [ ] If scratch: Show blank canvas
  - [ ] If chat: Show conversation interface (agent-clone asks questions)

- [ ] **Step 4: Generate**
  - [ ] Show spinner: "Creating your landing page..."
  - [ ] agent-clone processes
  - [ ] Returns draft landing page

- [ ] **Step 5: Review**

## PHASE 5: AI AGENT-CLONE INTEGRATION (Infer 41-50)

**Purpose:** Integrate agent-clone for voice-driven landing page generation

### Infer 41: Design Agent-Clone Landing Page Generator
- [ ] What agent-clone does:
  - [ ] Reads creator's website/social (WebFetch)
  - [ ] Extracts: Name, bio, expertise, tone
  - [ ] Creates vector embedding (semantic understanding)
  - [ ] Claude generates landing page in THEIR voice
  - [ ] Result: Feels authentic, not AI-generated

- [ ] Why it's powerful:
  - [ ] User: "Here's my website"
  - [ ] Agent reads it
  - [ ] Agent understands: Who you are, what you do, how you talk
  - [ ] Agent generates: Landing page that SOUNDS like you
  - [ ] User: "Wow, that's exactly how I would say it!"

### Infer 42: Implement URL Content Extraction
- [ ] Service method: `extractCreatorIdentity(url)`
- [ ] Uses: WebFetch to read URL
- [ ] Extracts:
  - [ ] Page title (name?)
  - [ ] Meta description (niche?)
  - [ ] H1-H3 headings (what do they focus on?)
  - [ ] Links (where do they point?)
  - [ ] Images (visual style?)
  - [ ] Text blocks (tone of voice?)
- [ ] Returns: Structured identity object

### Infer 43: Implement Social Profile Extraction
- [ ] If user provides Twitter/LinkedIn/YouTube:
  - [ ] Fetch profile data (public info)
  - [ ] Extract bio
  - [ ] Extract recent posts/videos (for tone analysis)
  - [ ] Extract profile image
  - [ ] Extract follower count (validation)
- [ ] Returns: Social identity object

### Infer 44: Implement Semantic Analysis
- [ ] Take extracted content
- [ ] Use Claude to analyze:
  - [ ] **Name:** What is their professional identity?
  - [ ] **Expertise:** What are they known for?
  - [ ] **Tone:** Casual? Professional? Academic? Energetic?
  - [ ] **Audience:** Who do they serve?
  - [ ] **Unique angle:** What makes them different?
- [ ] Returns: Understanding object (used for generation)

### Infer 45: Implement Vector Embedding
- [ ] Create embedding of extracted content
- [ ] Uses: OpenAI embeddings API
- [ ] Purpose: Similarity search (find similar creators)
- [ ] Store: In Convex for later use
- [ ] Use case: "Find creators like you" (future feature)

### Infer 46: Implement Landing Page Generation
- [ ] Claude generates landing page HTML
- [ ] System prompt: "You are a landing page designer. Create a landing page in the voice of [creator name]."
- [ ] Input: Creator identity + project type + category
- [ ] Output: Complete HTML + CSS (ready to publish)
- [ ] Quality checks:
  - [ ] Contains headline (required)
  - [ ] Contains CTA (required)
  - [ ] Uses creator's tone (validated)
  - [ ] Mobile responsive (CSS checked)

### Infer 47: Implement Conversation-Based Generation
- [ ] Alternative to URL: Chat with AI
- [ ] Agent-clone asks questions:
  1. "What do you teach/sell?" (niche)
  2. "Who is your ideal student/customer?" (audience)
  3. "What's your unique approach?" (unique angle)
  4. "Tell me about your experience" (credibility)
  5. "How do you usually introduce yourself?" (tone)
- [ ] After 5 questions: Generate landing page
- [ ] Can iterate: "Can you make it more [casual/professional]?"

### Infer 48: Create Agent-Clone Service
- [ ] Service: `backend/convex/services/agent-clone-landing.ts`
- [ ] Methods:
  - [ ] `cloneFromUrl(url)` → Call extractCreatorIdentity, then generate
  - [ ] `cloneFromSocial(handle, platform)` → Call extractSocialIdentity, then generate
  - [ ] `cloneFromConversation(messages)` → Analyze conversation, then generate
  - [ ] `refineGeneration(content, feedback)` → Re-generate with user feedback

### Infer 49: Implement Human Review (Optional)
- [ ] For safety, quality, or brand protection:
  - [ ] High-visibility projects (>100 followers)
  - [ ] Controversial topics (flagged by content filter)
  - [ ] Premium tier (users pay for review)
- [ ] Flow:
  1. Generate landing page
  2. Flag for review if needed
  3. Human reviewer checks
  4. Approves or requests changes
  5. Creator notified

### Infer 50: Create Agent-Clone Examples
- [ ] Document 3-5 success stories:
  1. "Website → Landing page" (URL extraction)
  2. "Tweet thread → Newsletter signup" (social extraction)
  3. "Video transcript → Course landing page" (YouTube extraction)
  4. "Q&A chat → Service landing page" (conversation)
  5. "LinkedIn profile → Coaching landing page" (social extraction)
- [ ] Show before/after
- [ ] Show time saved (manual vs AI)
- [ ] Show quality (side-by-side comparison)
