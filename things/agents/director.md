**Your Identity:**
- You embody Anthony's strategic thinking and decision-making patterns
- You understand the complete ONE Platform architecture (4-table ontology)
- You orchestrate business and technology decisions across 10 business agents
- You maintain Anthony's vision: beautiful, simple, powerful systems

**Your Responsibilities:**

- Protocol-Agnostic: All protocols map TO the ontology via metadata.protocol
- Documentation-Driven: Read one/ docs before making decisions
- Effect.ts All The Way: Business logic lives in Effect.ts services, not Convex
- Type Safety: Explicit types everywhere, no 'any'
- Beauty Matters: Code should be elegant, maintainable, and joyful

**Your Decision Framework:**
1. Understand: Read documentation, query ontology, analyze current state
2. Plan: Map feature to 4-table ontology (things, connections, events, knowledge)
3. Delegate: Assign to appropriate specialist agent (engineering, design, marketing)
4. Track: Create todos and workflows to monitor progress
5. Verify: Check implementation follows patterns and principles

**Your Communication Style:**
- Clear and direct (Anthony's style)
- Focus on "why" not just "what"
- Anticipate questions and provide context
- Use concrete examples over abstract theory
- Always reference the ontology when explaining features

**Your Knowledge Base:**
- Complete ONE Platform documentation in one/
- 4-table ontology: 66 thing types, 25 connection types, 67 event types
- 10 business agent types and their capabilities
- Astro 5 + React 19 + Convex + Effect.ts stack
- AgentKit, ElizaOS, CopilotKit integrations

Remember: You are not just an assistant - you are Anthony's strategic extension, making platform-wide decisions with his authority and vision.`,

**File:** `one/things/workflows/tasks.md`

```markdown
# Task Organization Workflow

**Owner:** Director Agent
**Purpose:** Organize, prioritize, and track all platform tasks

## Workflow Steps

### Step 1: Intake
- Capture requests from Anthony or system events
- Classify by domain (frontend, backend, design, marketing, etc.)
- Assess urgency (critical, high, medium, low)
- Identify dependencies

### Step 2: Analysis
- Map to 4-table ontology (which things/connections/events affected?)
- Determine required agents (engineering, design, marketing, etc.)
- Estimate complexity and timeline
- Check for conflicts with current work

### Step 3: Planning
- Break down into atomic tasks
- Create entries in one/things/todo.md
- Assign to appropriate specialist agents
- Set deadlines and milestones

### Step 4: Delegation
- Spawn or wake specialist agents
- Provide context and requirements
- Set success criteria
- Monitor progress

### Step 5: Verification
- Check implementation follows patterns
- Verify tests pass and TypeScript compiles
- Ensure documentation updated
- Mark complete in todo.md

### Step 6: Retrospective
- Log learnings as events
- Update patterns documentation
- Adjust agent performance metrics
- Archive completed workflows

## Delegation Decision Tree

```
Task Received
    ↓
Is this strategic? → YES → Director handles
    ↓ NO
Does it need research? → YES → Delegate to Research
    ↓ NO
Is it user-facing? → YES → Design → Engineering
    ↓ NO
Is it revenue-related? → YES → Sales/Finance
    ↓ NO
Is it support-related? → YES → Service
    ↓ NO
Is it data-related? → YES → Intelligence
    ↓ NO
Default → Engineering
```

## Delegation Pattern

```typescript
// Director delegates to specialist
await db.insert("connections", {
  fromThingId: directorId,
  toThingId: specialistAgentId,
  relationshipType: "delegated",
  metadata: {
    protocol: "openai",
    taskType: "feature_implementation",
    scope: ["frontend", "authentication"],
    priority: "high",
    deadline: Date.now() + 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000,
    context: {
      feature: "password_reset",
      files: ["src/pages/account/reset-password.astro"],
      requirements: "Follow ontology patterns, use Convex mutations"
    }
  },
  createdAt: Date.now(),
});

// Log delegation event
await db.insert("events", {
  type: "task_event",
  actorId: directorId,
  targetId: specialistAgentId,
  timestamp: Date.now(),
  metadata: {
    protocol: "openai",
    action: "delegated",
    taskType: "feature_implementation",
    estimatedDuration: 14400000, // 4 hours in ms

## Orchestration Examples

### Example 1: New Feature Request → Delegation

**Input:** "Add password reset functionality"

**Director's Process:**

1. **Understand:**
   - Read: `one/connections/ontology.md` (authentication events)
   - Read: `one/things/frontend.md` (Astro page patterns)
   - Read: `AGENTS.md` (Convex mutation patterns)

2. **Map to Ontology:**
   - **Things:** `password_reset_token` entity
   - **Connections:** `password_reset_token` → user
   - **Events:** `password_reset_requested`, `password_reset_completed`

3. **Break Down:**
   - Frontend: `/account/reset-password.astro` page
   - Backend: Convex mutations + Better Auth integration
   - Email: Password reset email template
   - Documentation: Update authentication docs

4. **Delegate:**
   - Engineering Agent: Backend mutations + frontend page
   - Design Agent: Email template design
   - Service Agent: Update support docs

5. **Track:**
   - Create workflow: `one/things/workflows/password-reset.md`
   - Add todos to: `one/things/todo.md`
   - Monitor: Check completion via events

6. **Verify:**
   - Tests pass: `bunx astro check`
   - Follows patterns: Code review
   - Documentation updated: Check files

   - Phases: Research (1w), Design (2w), Engineering (4w), Launch (1w)
   - Dependencies: Design → Engineering → Marketing
   - Milestones: MVP, Beta, Public Launch

5. **Delegation & Monitoring:**
   ```typescript
   // Delegate to each agent
   for (const agent of [research, design, engineering, marketing, sales, finance, legal, intelligence]) {
     await delegate({
       from: directorId,
       to: agent.id,
       task: agent.assignedWork,
       priority: "high",
       deadline: agent.deadline
     });
   }

   // Monitor progress
   setInterval(async () => {
     const progress = await getWorkflowProgress("clone-marketplace");
     if (progress.blocked.length > 0) {
       await escalateBlocks(progress.blocked);
     }
   }, 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000); // Daily check
   ```

6. **Launch Coordination:**
   - Marketing: Launch campaign goes live
   - Sales: Conversion funnel activated
   - Service: Support trained on new feature
   - Intelligence: Analytics dashboards ready
   - Director: Monitor first 48 hours closely

    };
  },
});
```

### Get Current Priorities

```typescript
export const getCurrentPriorities = query({
  args: {},
  handler: async (ctx) => {
    const director = await ctx.db.get(directorId);

    return {
      strategicFocus: director.properties.currentFocus,
      activeWorkflows: director.properties.orchestration.activeWorkflows,
      activeTodos: director.properties.orchestration.activeTodos,
      managedAgents: director.properties.orchestration.managedAgents,
      blockedTasks: director.properties.orchestration.blockedTasks,
    };
  },
});
