## PHASE 5: AI & RECOMMENDATION ENGINE (Infer 41-50)

**Purpose:** Build sophisticated product recommendation system

### Infer 41: Create Product Understanding Layer
- [ ] Extract rich metadata from products:
  - [ ] Brand, model, specs
  - [ ] User reviews (sentiment analysis)
  - [ ] Use cases (from description)
  - [ ] Target audience
  - [ ] Competitors + alternatives
- [ ] Store in product thing properties
- [ ] Used by AI to understand products deeply

### Infer 42: Create User Preference Extraction
- [ ] From conversation, extract:
  - [ ] Budget range
  - [ ] Skill level
  - [ ] Playing style (aggressive, defensive, etc)
  - [ ] Brand preferences
  - [ ] Material preferences (wood, graphite, etc)
  - [ ] Weight preferences
  - [ ] Color preferences (if mentioned)
  - [ ] Performance goals (speed, spin, control)
- [ ] Store in conversation thing properties
- [ ] Refine with each message

### Infer 43: Create Semantic Search
- [ ] Use embeddings for products:
  - [ ] Generate embedding for each product description
  - [ ] User query → embedding
  - [ ] Find closest products (cosine similarity)
  - [ ] Rank by relevance + rating + availability
  - [ ] Return top N results
- [ ] Better than keyword search
- [ ] Understands intent ("good for beginners" matches beginner-friendly rackets)

### Infer 44: Create Personalized Recommendation Engine
- [ ] Algorithm:
  1. Extract user preferences from conversation
  2. Weight products by how well they match:
     - Skill level match (heavy weight)
     - Budget match (heavy weight)
     - Playing style match (medium weight)
     - Brand preference (light weight)
  3. Filter: Must be in stock
  4. Filter: Minimum rating 3.5 stars
  5. Boost: Newly added products, best sellers
  6. Diversity: Don't recommend 3 identical products
  7. Return: Top 3 products with explanations
- [ ] Explainability: Always explain WHY (user trust)

### Infer 45: Create Comparison Generation
- [ ] When user asks to compare products:
  ```
  User: "How does the X1 compare to the Y2?"
  AI: "Great question! Here's a comparison:

  X1 Racket:
  - Weight: 350g (lighter, faster swings)
  - Sweet spot: Medium (forgiving)
  - Best for: Beginners
  - Price: €79

  Y2 Racket:
  - Weight: 380g (heavier, more control)
  - Sweet spot: Small (requires precision)
  - Best for: Intermediate players
  - Price: €129

  My recommendation for you: X1 is better because
  you mentioned you're starting out."
  ```
- [ ] Extract products mentioned
- [ ] Generate comparison table
- [ ] Make recommendation based on user profile

### Infer 46: Create Objection Handling
- [ ] Detect and address concerns:
  - [ ] "Is it durable?" → Mention warranty, materials
  - [ ] "Good for tournaments?" → Mention pros using it
  - [ ] "Can I upgrade later?" → Suggest upgrade path
  - [ ] "Is it worth it?" → Compare value vs alternatives
  - [ ] "Will it suit left-handers?" → Explain balance
- [ ] Use product reviews to address objections
- [ ] Be honest about limitations

### Infer 47: Create Upsell Logic
- [ ] Natural upselling:
  - [ ] After product selection: "Also popular with this: strings, grip"
  - [ ] Bundle offer: "Buy together, save 5%"
  - [ ] Upgrade suggestion: "For €20 more, you get..."
  - [ ] Related: "Many players also buy..."
- [ ] Not pushy, feels natural
- [ ] Only suggest if relevant to user profile

### Infer 48: Create Learning System
- [ ] AI improves recommendations over time:
  - [ ] Track which recommendations → purchases (success)
  - [ ] Track which recommendations → abandoned (failure)
  - [ ] Find patterns (what works, what doesn't)
  - [ ] Adjust product weights dynamically
  - [ ] A/B test recommendation strategies
- [ ] Per-creator insights:
  - [ ] Which users like their products?
  - [ ] How to position product for conversation?

### Infer 49: Create Conversation Memory
- [ ] AI remembers across sessions:
  - [ ] User: "I bought the X1 from your last recommendation"
  - [ ] AI: "Great! How are you enjoying it?"
  - [ ] User: "I love it, now I want strings"
  - [ ] AI: "Perfect, these strings are designed for X1"
- [ ] Cross-session continuity
- [ ] Personalization deepens

### Infer 50: Create RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
- [ ] Combine AI reasoning with product database:
  - [ ] User question → Search product database
  - [ ] Retrieve relevant products + reviews
  - [ ] Pass to Claude with context
  - [ ] Claude generates informed response
  - [ ] Response includes product recommendations
- [ ] Better accuracy (grounded in real data)
- [ ] Always up-to-date (live product info)
