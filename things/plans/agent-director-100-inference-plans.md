# Agent Director: 100-Inference Plan Generation

**Version:** 2.0.0
**Status:** Specification Complete
**Type:** Enhancement to agent-director
**Purpose:** Generate executable 100-inference plans from feature selections

---

## Overview

The agent-director has been enhanced to generate complete 100-inference plans from user feature selections. This transforms the onboarding experience from manual planning to automated, intelligent plan generation with real-time execution tracking.

**Key Innovation:** Plans are inference-based (not time-based), enabling precise execution, transparent progress tracking, and intelligent coordination across specialist agents.

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Feature Library (20+ Features)

Complete library mapping every feature to specific inference ranges:

### 2. Plan Generation Algorithm

**6-Step Process:**

1. **Read Feature Selections** - From `.onboarding.json` or user input
2. **Resolve Dependencies** - Automatically include required features
3. **Map to Inference Ranges** - Assign phases with specialist agents
4. **Calculate Estimates** - Total duration, cost, inference count
5. **Generate Execution Plan** - Complete ExecutionPlan structure
6. **Write to Files** - Save JSON plan + markdown summary

### 3. Execution Coordination

**Event-Driven Workflow:**

1. Emit `phase_started` event
2. Delegate to specialist agent
3. Monitor progress via events
4. Update `.onboarding.json` progress
5. Emit `phase_complete` event

**Progress Tracking:**

- Real-time updates to `.onboarding.json`
- Completion percentage calculation
- Current inference tracking
- Phase status tracking (pending → in_progress → completed)

**Error Handling:**

- Retry with exponential backoff (max 3 attempts)
- Delegate to problem-solver on final failure
- Error logging to `.onboarding.json`

### 4. Data Structures

**ExecutionPlan:**

```typescript
interface ExecutionPlan {
  version: string;
  organizationName: string;
  createdAt: number;
  plan: {
    phases: Phase[];
    totalInferences: number;
    currentInference: number;
    completedInferences: number[];
    estimates: {
      duration: string;
      cost: string;
      inferences: number;
    };
  };
  progress: {
    status: "pending" | "in_progress" | "completed";
    startedAt?: number;
    completedAt?: number;
    currentPhase?: string;
  };
}
```

**Phase:**

```typescript
interface Phase {
  name: string;
  featureKey: string;
  inferences: { start: number; end: number };
  specialist: string;
  duration: string;
  cost: string;
  status: "pending" | "in_progress" | "completed" | "failed";
  ontology: {
    things?: string[];
    connections?: string[];
    events?: string[];
    knowledge?: string[];
  };
}
```
