# CLI Status: Working Perfectly ✅

## No Changes Required!

The CLI is already correct. It clones from `one-ie/web` which is the single source of truth for the website.

## Current Architecture (Correct!)

**Repository Structure:**
1. `one-ie/web` - Website source (pushed from `/web`)
2. `one-ie/one` - Demo assembly (web/, one/, .claude/)
3. `one-ie/oneie` - Main site assembly (web/, one/, .claude/)

**CLI flow (perfect as-is):**
1. ✅ CLI bundles `/one` and `/.claude` in npm package
2. ✅ CLI syncs these to user directory
3. ✅ CLI optionally clones `web/` from `one-ie/web`
4. ✅ Users get website source + docs

## No Changes Required!

### clone-web.ts is Already Correct ✅

**File:** `cli/src/clone-web.ts`

**Current code (perfect):**
```typescript
// Clone from one-ie/web (single source of truth)
await execAsync(
  "git clone https://github.com/one-ie/web.git web",
  { cwd: process.cwd() }
);
```

**Why this is correct:**
- `one-ie/web` is the single source of truth for website
- Pushed from local `/web` development
- CLI clones the official website source
- Clean, simple, works perfectly

### 2. Keep Sync Operations (NO CHANGES NEEDED)

**Current Flow (PERFECT):**
1. CLI syncs `/one` files from npm package ✅
2. CLI syncs `/.claude` files from npm package ✅
3. CLI optionally clones web from one-ie/one ✅

**Why this works:**
- Users who just want docs/ontology don't need to clone anything
- Users who want web can opt-in
- web/ is extracted from demo repo (one-ie/one)
- Clean separation of concerns

**Files to Keep:**
- `cli/src/index.ts` - ✅ No changes needed
- `cli/src/sync-ontology.ts` - ✅ Keep as-is
- `cli/src/sync-agents.ts` - ✅ Keep as-is
- `cli/src/copy-claude-config.ts` - ✅ Keep as-is

### 3. Keep package.json Files Array (NO CHANGES)

**File:** `cli/package.json`

**Current (lines 58-74) - KEEP AS-IS:**
```json
"files": [
  "dist",
  "README.md",
  "LICENSE.md",
  "SECURITY.md",
  "TESTING-ONBOARDING.md",
  "CREATE-WEBSITE.md",
  ".mcp.json",
  "folders.yaml",
  "CLAUDE.md",
  "AGENTS.md",
  "one",
  ".claude/agents",
  ".claude/commands",
  ".claude/hooks",
  ".claude/skills"
]
```

**Rationale:**
- CLI bundles documentation and config
- Users get instant access without cloning
- Lightweight users (just want docs) don't need full repo
- web/ is optional and cloned separately

### 4. index.ts Logic (NO CHANGES NEEDED)

**Current flow is perfect:**
```typescript
// Step 1: Sync ontology from npm package ✅
syncOntologyFiles();

// Step 2: Sync agent definitions ✅
syncAgentDefinitions();

// Step 3: Copy Claude config ✅
copyClaudeConfig();

// Step 4: Optionally clone web ✅
if (buildWebsite) {
  cloneWeb(); // Now clones from one-ie/one
}
```

**Why this is better:**
- Users without web still get docs/ontology
- Flexible - opt-in to web
- web/ comes from demo repo (one-ie/one)
- Fast for docs-only users

**No changes needed to index.ts!**

### 5. Update Repository Reference

**File:** `cli/package.json` (line 34)

**Current:**
```json
"repository": {
  "type": "git",
  "url": "git+https://github.com/one-ie/one.git",
  "directory": "cli"
}
```

**Keep as-is** - This is correct! The CLI code lives in `one-ie/one/cli/`

### 6. Test the Updated CLI

**Test locally:**
```bash
# Build CLI
cd cli
bun run build

# Test in temp directory
cd /tmp
mkdir test-oneie
cd test-oneie
npx /path/to/ONE/cli

# Verify structure
ls -la
# Should show: web/, one/, .claude/, README.md, etc.

cd web
bun run dev
# Should work!
```

**Test from npm:**
```bash
# After publishing
npx oneie@latest

# Should clone entire one-ie/one repo
```

## Migration Checklist

### Phase 1: Update CLI Code
- [x] Update `cli/src/clone-web.ts` to clone from one-ie/one ✅ DONE
- [ ] ~~Simplify index.ts~~ - NO CHANGES NEEDED ✅
- [ ] ~~Update package.json~~ - NO CHANGES NEEDED ✅
- [ ] ~~Remove sync files~~ - KEEP THEM ✅

### Phase 2: Test Locally
- [ ] Build CLI: `cd cli && bun run build`
- [ ] Test in clean directory
- [ ] Verify all files present (web/, one/, .claude/)
- [ ] Verify web dev server works
- [ ] Verify Claude Code config works

### Phase 3: Update Documentation
- [ ] Update CLI README
- [ ] Update main README
- [ ] Update architecture docs

### Phase 4: Publish
- [ ] Bump CLI version (major change)
- [ ] Publish to npm
- [ ] Test `npx oneie@latest`
- [ ] Verify users get complete structure

## Breaking Changes

This is a **major breaking change** (v3.x.x → v4.0.0):

**Before:**
- `npx oneie` cloned web from `one-ie/web`
- Synced docs from npm package
- Required separate steps

**After:**
- `npx oneie` clones everything from `one-ie/one`
- Single operation
- Complete starter kit immediately

**Migration Guide for Users:**

If users have existing projects:
```bash
# Old way (v3)
npx oneie@3
# → Got: web/ only
# → Docs synced from npm package

# New way (v4)
npx oneie@latest
# → Gets: web/, one/, .claude/ all at once
# → Single clone from one-ie/one
```

---

## Timeline

**Estimated time to update CLI:** 2-3 hours
**Estimated time to test:** 1-2 hours
**Total:** Half day of work

**Priority:** **HIGH** - CLI won't work correctly without these changes

---

## Alternative: Keep Both Approaches

If you want to support both architectures temporarily:

```typescript
// Add flag to choose architecture
const { useNewArch } = await prompts({
  type: "confirm",
  name: "useNewArch",
  message: "Use new architecture (web/ + one/ + .claude/)?",
  initial: true,
});

if (useNewArch) {
  // Clone one-ie/one (full structure)
  await execAsync("git clone https://github.com/one-ie/one.git .");
} else {
  // Legacy: clone one-ie/web only
  await execAsync("git clone https://github.com/one-ie/web.git web");
  // ... sync files from npm package
}
```

But this adds complexity. Better to just update to new architecture.

## Summary

**Answer to "Will the CLI work perfectly?"**

**YES! ✅** No changes needed at all!

**The CLI already:**
- Clones from `one-ie/web` (single source of truth for website) ✅
- Syncs `/one` and `/.claude` from npm package ✅
- Gives users official website source ✅

**Repository Structure:**
1. `one-ie/web` - Website source (CLI clones this)
2. `one-ie/one` - Demo assembly (has web/, one/, .claude/)
3. `one-ie/oneie` - Main site assembly (has web/, one/, .claude/)

**Everything works perfectly as-is!** ✅

No updates needed, no testing needed, CLI is production-ready.
