## Executive Summary

This plan defines the **complete onboarding experience** for ONE Platform, where a user:

1. Runs `npx oneie init` (1 minute)
2. Provides basic info (name, org, website, email)
3. CLI analyzes their website with AI (30 seconds)
4. User selects features to build (2 minutes)
5. Claude Code builds and deploys iteratively (45-70 minutes)
6. **Result:** Fully functional, personalized platform on custom domain

**Key Innovation:** The platform is **personalized** by analyzing the user's existing website - extracting their brand colors, logo, fonts, and generating a custom 6-dimension ontology that matches their business model.
