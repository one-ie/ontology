# Wave 1: Creator Onboarding - Vision Document

**Version:** 1.0.0
**Status:** Ready for Implementation
**Last Updated:** 2025-11-01

---

## Executive Summary

Wave 1 Creator Onboarding is the **critical path foundation** for the ONE platform. This feature enables creators to register, verify their email, complete their profile, create a workspace, invite team members, connect wallets, and begin monetizing.

This is **NOT** a standalone feature - it's the prerequisite that unblocks all downstream work (monetization, agents, API, e-commerce). Without creator onboarding, no one can use the platform.

**Timeline:** Infer 1-100 (approximately 8-12 inferences per specialist per day)
**Team:** 4 specialists (backend, frontend, quality, designer) + documentation
**Scope:** 8-stage signup flow + workspace management + team collaboration

---

## 6-Dimension Ontology Validation

### GROUPS (Isolation & Hierarchy)

**Onboarding maps perfectly to the Groups dimension:**

- **Creator's workspace** = New `group` (type: "organization")
- **Team members** = Additional people added to the group via `member_of` connections
- **Hierarchical structure:** Personal workspace (level 1) → optional sub-groups for departments (level 2+)
- **Group ownership:** Creator becomes the `group_owner` of their workspace
- **Data scoping:** All creator's content, team, and settings are scoped to this group

**Example:**
```
Creator "Jane" registers
  ↓ Creates workspace "Jane's Studio" (group)
    ├─ Jane is group_owner (role: "group_owner")
    ├─ Invites Editor "Bob" (role: "group_user")
    └─ All content/analytics scoped to this group
```

### PEOPLE (Authorization & Governance)

**Onboarding maps perfectly to the People dimension:**

- **Creator thing** = Person with properties (email, username, bio, avatar, skills, interests)
- **Roles:** Creator starts as `group_owner` in their workspace
- **Permissions:** Workspace owner can manage team, billing, settings
- **Additional roles:** Editor, Viewer (for team members)
- **Authentication:** Email + password verified via verification code
- **Governance:** Creator controls who can access their workspace

**Role Hierarchy:**
```
Platform Owner (global)
└─ Creator (group_owner)
   ├─ Team Member (group_user) - Editor/Viewer roles
   ├─ Team Member (group_user) - Editor/Viewer roles
   └─ ...
```

### THINGS (Entities)

**Onboarding creates and manages these thing types:**

1. **creator** (person) - The registered user
   - Email, username, displayName, bio, avatar
   - Niche, expertise, interests
   - Workspace IDs, roles
   - Wallet address (optional)
   - Onboarding status/completion tracking

2. **organization** (workspace group) - Created during workspace setup
   - Name, slug, description, logo
   - Plan (starter/pro/enterprise)
   - Member count, visibility settings

3. **invitation_token** - For team member invitations
   - Token, invitedEmail, workspaceId, role
   - Status (pending/accepted/expired), expiresAt

4. **verification_token** - For email verification
   - Token, userId, type (email/2fa)
   - ExpiresAt, attempts, maxAttempts

5. **ui_preferences** - User settings & preferences
   - Theme, language, timezone, notification settings

**All scoped to group:** Every thing is associated with `groupId` (creator's workspace)

### CONNECTIONS (Relationships)

**Onboarding creates these relationship types:**

1. **member_of** (creator → workspace group)
   - Metadata: role (group_owner), permissions, joinedAt

2. **member_of** (team member → workspace group)
   - Metadata: role (group_user), permissions, invitedBy, invitedAt, status

3. **owns** (creator → created content/resources)
   - Will be used for content ownership post-onboarding

**Connection Pattern:**
```
creator_jane → workspace_jane_studio (member_of, role: "group_owner")
editor_bob   → workspace_jane_studio (member_of, role: "group_user", status: "pending/active")
```

### EVENTS (Actions & Audit Trail)

**Onboarding logs these event types:**

- `user_registered` - Signup form submitted
- `email_verification_sent` - Verification code sent
- `email_verified` - Email confirmed
- `profile_updated` - Profile completed
- `thing_created` (thingType: "organization") - Workspace created
- `user_invited_to_group` - Team member invited
- `user_joined_group` - Team member accepted
- `wallet_connected` - Crypto wallet linked
- `thing_updated` (thingType: "creator") - Skills added
- `onboarding_completed` - Full journey done

**Complete Audit Trail:** Every step logged for analytics, funnel tracking, and debugging

### KNOWLEDGE (Taxonomy & RAG)

**Onboarding connects creators to knowledge labels:**

- **Skills/Expertise:** skill:video-editing, skill:copywriting, skill:fitness-coaching
- **Industries:** industry:fitness, industry:education, industry:finance
- **Interests:** topic:personal-branding, topic:monetization, topic:community
- **Platform Goals:** goal:income, goal:audience, goal:collaboration, goal:learning

**Knowledge Pattern:**
```
creator_jane links to knowledge items:
  ├─ skill:fitness-coaching
  ├─ skill:social-media
  ├─ industry:wellness
  ├─ goal:income
  └─ goal:community
```

These labels enable:
- Smart recommendations (show relevant products/courses/agents)
- Cohort discovery (find similar creators)
- Personalized dashboard (show relevant features)
- Semantic search (find by expertise/interest)

## Integration Points

### 1. Better Auth (Authentication)

**Current state:** Email/password + OAuth working in production
**Onboarding adds:**
- Email verification flow (6-digit code via Resend)
- User creation in Better Auth
- Session creation for authenticated requests
- Login redirect after onboarding complete

**API Integration:**
```
signup → Create user in Better Auth
  ↓
send verification email → Resend
  ↓
verify code → Mark user as verified
  ↓
login → Get session token
```

### 2. Convex (Database)

**Creates:**
- `creator` thing (in entities table)
- `organization` thing (workspace, in entities table)
- `member_of` connection (creator → workspace)
- Verification tokens for email flow
- Events for every transition

**Tables touched:**
- `entities` (creator, workspace things)
- `connections` (team membership)
- `events` (audit trail)
- `groups` (workspace group)

### 3. Email (Resend)

**Sends:**
- Welcome email (after signup)
- Verification code (6-digit, 10-min expiry)
- Team invitation (if inviting others)
- Password reset (if requested)
- Onboarding reminder (if abandoned)

### 4. Wallet (viem/wagmi) - Optional

**For X402 protocol:**
- Detect MetaMask, Rainbow Kit, WalletConnect
- Request wallet connection
- Sign message to verify ownership
- Store wallet address in creator properties
- Display wallet balance (future: X402 earnings)

### 5. Analytics

**Track every transition:**
- Conversion funnel (which stage drops off?)
- Time in each stage
- Device/browser (mobile vs desktop)
- Signup source (direct, OAuth provider, referral)
- Completion rate by cohort

---

## Dependencies

### Block Everything Until Ready

**Wave 1 blocks:**
- Wave 2 (Monetization) - Needs creators first
- Wave 3 (Agents) - Needs authenticated creators
- Wave 4 (API) - Needs API keys (requires creator)
- Wave 5 (E-commerce) - Needs workspace for product management
- All team features - Needs workspace + team members

### Requirements Met

✅ Better Auth working (email/password + OAuth)
✅ Convex schema defined (groups, entities, connections, events)
✅ Resend integrated (email sending)
✅ Production Convex Cloud deployed
✅ Frontend React 19 ready
✅ Backend TypeScript fixed

**Everything needed is ready. This is a pure build.**

---

## Out of Scope (Wave 2+)

These features are intentionally **NOT** in Wave 1:

- **Monetization:** No stripe, no pricing, no products yet
- **AI Agents:** No agent deployment, no AI clone
- **Analytics:** No detailed dashboard stats
- **Advanced team:** No fine-grained permissions, no audit logs per action
- **Advanced wallet:** No balance display, no transaction history
- **Advanced profile:** No portfolio, no testimonials, no verification badges
- **Content creation:** No editor, no publishing system
- **Community:** No forums, no messaging

These are all Wave 2+. Wave 1 is **purely onboarding**.

---

## Success Criteria for Wave 1 Complete

Wave 1 is done when:

- ✅ User can register with email + password
- ✅ Email verification works (code sent + verified)
- ✅ Profile form complete + avatar upload working
- ✅ Workspace creation working
- ✅ Team member invitations working (send + accept)
- ✅ Wallet connection optional but functional
- ✅ Skills/expertise tagging working
- ✅ Onboarding status tracked (events logged)
- ✅ 80%+ of test users complete full flow
- ✅ Average time < 15 minutes
- ✅ Mobile-responsive (70%+ desktop conversion on mobile)
- ✅ Accessibility compliant (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- ✅ New creator can access dashboard
- ✅ Team features tested (invite, accept, roles visible)
- ✅ Complete audit trail (all events logged)
- ✅ API documented + ready for Wave 2

---

## What Happens After Onboarding

**Day 1:**
- Creator sees dashboard
- Dashboard shows quick wins checklist (if not completed)
- Suggestions for next steps (create content, connect wallet, invite team)
- "Recommended for you" section (based on skills/interests)

**Day 2-7:**
- First content created (or first sale)
- First X402 payment received (if wallet connected)
- First team member joins (if invited)
- First earnings visible
- Email: "You earned X tokens!"

**Week 2-4:**
- Decide to upgrade to pro plan
- Buy first AI agent or course
- Publish second piece of content
- Invite more team members
- Build audience

**Month 2+:**
- Platform becomes primary revenue stream
- Team grows
- AI agents deployed
- Community engaged
- Becomes advocate (invites friends)
