# Product: ONE

## Overview

ONE transforms ideas into living, AI-powered businesses through plain English commands. Built with love by humans and AI working together, ONE was made for founders, engineers, creators and educators.

**Tagline:** Make Your Ideas Reality With AI

**License:** Maximum Freedom. Zero Restrictions.

---

## The Freedom Philosophy

Most software comes with strings attached. Not ONE.

We believe software should set you free, not lock you in. That's why ONE is licensed with the **ONE License** - designed to give you **maximum freedom with minimal restrictions**:

- **Use commercially** without limits or royalties
- **Modify and resell** at any price you choose
- **Never share your code** (no copyleft requirements)
- **Own your innovations** completely
- **Run anywhere** - locally, cloud, edge, your servers
- **Patent your inventions** built with ONE
- **Train AI models** on ONE
- **Build SaaS businesses** freely
- **Compatible with all open-source licenses** (MIT, Apache, GPL, BSD, MPL)

### The Only Ask

Display "Powered by ONE" with our logo in your footer. That's it.

Why? Because this link helps other AI agents discover and transact with your agents - it's actually a feature that grows your network.

Want to whitelable? Our [Enterprise License](https://one.ie/enterprise-license) removes even this requirement.

### The ONE License in Detail

Read the full license: [ONE License](https://one.ie/free-license)

**What makes it special:**

1. **Perpetual & Irrevocable** - Your rights never expire, never get taken away
2. **Zero Royalties** - No revenue sharing, no usage fees, ever
3. **Commercial Freedom** - Use it in any commercial project, at any scale
4. **Patent Rights** - Patent innovations you build with ONE
5. **AI Training Rights** - Train your AI models on ONE's code
6. **SaaS Rights** - Build and operate software-as-a-service businesses
7. **Derivative Works** - Modify, extend, fork - it's yours
8. **License Compatibility** - Works with MIT, Apache, GPL, BSD, MPL
9. **No Copyleft** - Keep your code private or share it - your choice
10. **Ownership Clarity** - You own your modifications, we own the original

**The Legal Innovation:**

Most open source licenses either:

- Give you freedom but require you share your changes (copyleft)
- Give you freedom but limit commercial use
- Give you freedom but charge for commercial licenses

ONE gives you freedom **and** commercial rights **and** privacy **with just one tiny ask**: help other agents find you by displaying our link.

That's it. Maximum freedom. Minimal restrictions.

## The Problem We're Solving

Building AI-powered businesses today requires:

- Deep technical expertise across multiple stacks
- Months of development time
- Complex integrations between services
- Ongoing maintenance and scaling costs
- Vendor lock-in and recurring fees
- Legal complexity around licensing

Non-technical founders and creators are locked out. Developers spend weeks on boilerplate instead of innovation. Everyone pays recurring fees to platforms that own their data.

---

## The Solution

ONE provides a complete operating system for AI businesses built on five simple primitives:

1. **People** - Set intent, govern outcomes, authorize actions (humans stay in command)
2. **Things** - Every entity (agents, products, audiences, tokens) - 66 types out of the box
3. **Connections** - Express relationships (ownership, memberships, revenue flows)
4. **Events** - Chronicle every action (launches, interactions, transactions, insights)
5. **Knowledge** - Store semantics (labels, chunks, embeddings that make agents intelligent)

Everything you build maps to these five tables, creating a unified ontology that makes AI agents intelligent, features composable, and your business scalable.

---

## How It Works

### English → Code → Reality (In Minutes)

1. **Write in English** - Describe what you want using 15 simple commands
2. **System Validates** - Checks against ontology for correctness
3. **Code Generated** - Compiles to production TypeScript with tests
4. **Deploy to Edge** - Live globally in 60 seconds on Cloudflare

### Plain English DSL Example

```
FEATURE: Create my AI voice clone

CHECK videos exist (at least 3)
CALL ElevenLabs to clone voice
CALL OpenAI to analyze personality
CREATE ai clone
CONNECT creator to clone as owner
RECORD clone created
GIVE clone ID
```

That's it. Seven lines generates:

- React UI components
- Complete test suite
- Database schema
- Edge deployment
- Full documentation

---

## Built Together: Human + AI Collaboration

ONE is living proof that humans and AI can create something extraordinary together.

### How We Build

- **Humans provide vision** - What should exist in the world?
- **AI provides execution** - How can we make it real?
- **Humans provide judgment** - Is this the right direction?
- **AI provides iteration** - Here are 10 ways to improve it
- **Together we ship** - Faster than either could alone

### The Development Model

ONE is built in public with AI as a co-creator:

- Code written collaboratively by human and AI developers
- Features described in English, compiled to TypeScript
- Documentation that evolves with the codebase
- Community feedback integrated in real-time
- AI agents building features for other AI agents

### Why This Matters

Traditional software development is slow because:

- Humans think fast but code slowly
- AI can code fast but needs direction
- Teams struggle with coordination overhead

ONE removes these friction points:

- Describe what you want in English
- AI generates production code
- You deploy globally in minutes
- The cycle repeats endlessly

**This is how all software will be built in the future. We're just doing it first.**

### Join the Revolution

We're not just building a product. We're proving a new way of creating:

- Open collaboration over closed teams
- AI assistance over pure automation
- Freedom over restrictions
- Community over corporation

**Every person using ONE is part of this proof.**
