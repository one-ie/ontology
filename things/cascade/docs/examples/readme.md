# CASCADE Feature Examples

**Real-world examples of the 6-level workflow in action**

These are the actual features used to build the CASCADE system itself. They demonstrate the complete workflow from specification through implementation.

## What Each Feature Contains

Each feature directory includes:

### 1. Feature Specification (`{feature-name}.md`)
- **What we're building** (not how)
- **Ontology types** (things, connections, events, knowledge)
- **Scope** (backend, frontend, integration)
- **Success criteria** (linked to tests)

### 2. Tests (`{feature-name}/tests.md`)
- **User flows** (what users accomplish)
- **Acceptance criteria** (how we know it works)
- **Technical tests** (unit, integration, e2e)
- **Definition of done** (complete checklist)

### 3. Design (`{feature-name}/design.md`)
- **Design decisions** (driven by test requirements)
- **Architecture** (component structure)
- **Design tokens** (configuration)
- **Wireframes/diagrams** (visual representation)

## How to Use These Examples

### For Learning

1. **Read in order:** 1-1 → 1-2 → 1-3 → 1-4 → 1-5 → 1-6
2. **Study the pattern:** Spec → Tests → Design → Implementation
3. **Notice the flow:** Each level adds clarity and reduces ambiguity

### For Your Own Features

1. **Use as templates:** Copy structure for your features
2. **Adapt the patterns:** Similar problems have similar solutions
3. **Reference the tests:** See how user flows drive design

### For Understanding CASCADE

1. **Feature 1-1:** Shows how agents are defined (prompts)
2. **Feature 1-2:** Shows how workflow is configured (YAML)
3. **Feature 1-3:** Shows how agents coordinate (events)
4. **Feature 1-4:** Shows how knowledge accumulates (lessons learned)
5. **Feature 1-5:** Shows how quality is maintained (loops + problem solving)
6. **Feature 1-6:** Shows how work is organized (numbering system)

## The 6-Level Workflow (Demonstrated)

Each feature demonstrates the complete flow:

```
LEVEL 1: IDEA
└─> Feature 1-1: "Need agent prompts for 8 roles"

LEVEL 2: PLAN
└─> Plan 1: "Agent-Based Workflow System" (features 1-1 through 1-6)

LEVEL 3: FEATURE
└─> Feature 1-1: "Agent Prompts System" (specification)

LEVEL 4: TESTS
└─> 1-1-agent-prompts/tests.md (user flows + acceptance criteria)

LEVEL 5: DESIGN
└─> 1-1-agent-prompts/design.md (prompt structure + architecture)

LEVEL 6: IMPLEMENTATION
└─> one/things/agents/*.md (12 agent prompt files)
```

## Key Patterns to Notice

### 1. Test-Driven Everything
- Tests define user flows BEFORE implementation
- Design decisions are driven by test requirements
- Implementation exists to satisfy tests

### 2. Ontology Alignment
- Every feature maps to 6-dimension ontology
- Things, connections, events, knowledge always identified
- Validation against ontology structure

### 3. Progressive Refinement
- Each level adds more detail
- Ambiguity decreases as you move through levels
- Implementation becomes obvious by Level 6

### 4. Event Coordination
- Agents log events to coordinate
- No complex handoff protocols
- Complete audit trail

### 5. Knowledge Accumulation
- Problems become lessons learned
- Patterns emerge from experience
- Quality improves over time

## Compare These Examples

### Simple Feature (1-1: Agent Prompts)
- ✅ Single specialist (Backend)
- ✅ Clear deliverable (markdown files)
- ✅ No dependencies
- ✅ Straightforward tests

### Complex Feature (1-5: Quality Loops)
- ✅ Multiple agents (Quality + Problem Solver)
- ✅ Abstract deliverable (problem-solving flow)
- ✅ Dependencies on 1-1, 1-3
- ✅ Sophisticated tests (ultrathink mode validation)

Both follow the same 6-level workflow. Complexity doesn't change the process.

## Learning Path

### Beginner: Start Here
1. Read **Feature 1-1** (Agent Prompts) - simplest example
2. Study the tests - see how user flows are defined
3. Look at the design - see how structure emerges from tests
4. Check implementation - see prompts in `one/things/agents/`

### Intermediate: Understand Coordination
1. Read **Feature 1-3** (Event Coordination) - agent communication
2. Study the event types - see how agents coordinate
3. Look at the patterns - no handoff protocols needed
4. Understand autonomy - agents watch events and act

### Advanced: Master Quality
1. Read **Feature 1-5** (Quality Loops) - self-healing systems
2. Study problem solving - ultrathink mode analysis
3. Look at knowledge capture - lessons learned system
4. Understand continuous improvement - quality over time

## Real-World Application

These features show how to:

- ✅ Break complex systems into manageable features
- ✅ Define clear acceptance criteria before coding
- ✅ Design test-driven architectures
- ✅ Coordinate multiple agents autonomously
- ✅ Build systems that learn and improve
- ✅ Maintain quality through automatic loops
- ✅ Document as you build

**Result:** Production-ready CASCADE system built using its own workflow.

## Next Steps

1. **Study one feature deeply:** Pick 1-1 or 1-3, understand completely
2. **Try the template:** Use `../../../templates/feature-template.md` for your feature
3. **Follow the flow:** Spec → Tests → Design → Implementation
4. **Use CASCADE:** Run `/one` and build something real

**Built by CASCADE, for CASCADE users**

These examples prove the system works. Now use it to build something amazing.
