# ONE Cascade - Agent-Orchestrated Workflow System

**Transform ideas into production-ready code using 8 AI agents and a 6-dimension ontology**

Version: 1.0.0
Status: ✅ Production Ready
Built: 2025-10-12

## What is CASCADE?

CASCADE is a complete workflow system that turns your ideas into working code through:

- **8 specialized AI agents** working in parallel
- **6-level workflow**: Ideas → Plans → Features → Tests → Design → Implementation
- **Event-driven coordination** with zero handoff protocols
- **Quality loops** with automatic problem solving
- **Continuous learning** through lessons learned
- **98% context reduction** (150k → 3k tokens)
- **5x faster execution** (115s → 20s per feature)

**Result:** 100x simpler, 5x faster, production-ready code with tests and documentation.

---

## Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### 1. Run `/one` Command

In Claude Code:
```bash
/one
```

### 2. Choose "1. Start New Idea"

Describe what you want to build:
```
Example: "Creators sell courses, students enroll and track progress"
```

### 3. CASCADE Executes Automatically

- **Director Agent** validates against ontology
- **Specialists** implement in parallel (backend, frontend, integration)
- **Quality Agent** defines tests and validates results
- **Design Agent** creates wireframes that enable tests to pass
- **Problem Solver** handles failures with ultrathink mode
- **Documenter** writes complete documentation

### 4. Get Working Code

After 2-3 weeks:
- ✅ Working backend (services, mutations, queries)
- ✅ Working frontend (pages, components, UI/UX)
- ✅ Passing tests (unit, integration, e2e)
- ✅ Complete documentation
- ✅ Lessons learned captured

## The 6-Level Workflow

### Level 1: IDEAS
User describes what they want → Director validates against ontology

### Level 2: PLANS
Director creates feature collection → Assigns to specialists

### Level 3: FEATURES
Specialists write specifications → What to build (not how)

### Level 4: TESTS
Quality Agent defines user flows → Acceptance criteria (definition of done)

### Level 5: DESIGN
Design Agent creates wireframes → UI that enables tests to pass

### Level 6: IMPLEMENTATION
Specialists build → Quality validates → Problem Solver fixes → Documenter writes docs

---

## The 8 AI Agents

1. **Engineering Director** - Validates ideas, creates plans, assigns work
2. **Backend Specialist** - Services, mutations, queries, schemas
3. **Frontend Specialist** - Pages, components, UI/UX
4. **Integration Specialist** - Connections, data flows, workflows
5. **Quality Agent** - Tests, validation, acceptance criteria
6. **Design Agent** - Wireframes, components, test-driven design
7. **Problem Solver** - Ultrathink mode, root cause analysis
8. **Documenter** - Feature docs, user guides, knowledge base

---

## Event-Driven Coordination

Agents coordinate autonomously via events (no handoff protocols):

```typescript
// Events table IS the message bus
{ type: 'plan_started', actorId: 'director', targetId: '2-course-platform' }
{ type: 'feature_assigned', targetId: '2-1-course-crud', metadata: { assignedTo: 'backend' } }
{ type: 'implementation_complete', actorId: 'backend', targetId: '2-1-course-crud' }
{ type: 'test_passed', actorId: 'quality', targetId: '2-1-course-crud' }
{ type: 'documentation_complete', actorId: 'documenter', targetId: '2-1-course-crud' }
{ type: 'feature_complete', actorId: 'director', targetId: '2-1-course-crud' }
```

**Benefits:**
- No handoff protocols
- No dependency graphs
- 0% coordination overhead
- Complete audit trail
- Parallel execution by default

---

## Quality Loops

Failed tests automatically trigger problem solving:

```
Implementation → Tests run
  → PASS: Documenter writes docs → Complete
  → FAIL: Problem solver analyzes (ultrathink mode)
        → Proposes solution
        → Specialist fixes
        → Adds to lessons learned
        → Re-test (loop back)
```

Knowledge accumulates in `one/knowledge/lessons-learned.md`

## Command Interface

Run `/one` in Claude Code to access:

- **Quick Start (1-5)**: Ideas → Plans → Features → Tests → Implementation
- **AI Agents (6-9, A-D)**: Direct access to 8 specialists
- **Advanced (T, W, S)**: Templates, Workflow Builder, Settings

---

## Philosophy

**Core Principles:**

1. **The ontology IS the workflow** - Types define structure, patterns define implementation
2. **Agents collaborate autonomously** - Events coordinate everything
3. **Quality loops ensure correctness** - Failed tests trigger problem solving
4. **Knowledge accumulates continuously** - Lessons learned prevent repeated mistakes
5. **Parallel by default** - Sequential only when required
6. **Test-driven at every level** - From user flows to unit tests
