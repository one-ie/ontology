# ONE Platform Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** October 16, 2025
**Last Updated:** October 16, 2025
**Version:** 1.0.0

## 1. Introduction

Welcome to ONE Platform ("we," "us," or "our"). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and protect your information when you use our AI-native platform available at https://one.ie and through our CLI tool `npx oneie` (collectively, the "Platform").

**ONE Platform is built on a 6-dimension ontology** that models reality through Groups, People, Things, Connections, Events, and Knowledge. This privacy policy is structured to map directly to this architecture, ensuring transparency about exactly where and how your data flows through our system.

**Key Privacy Commitments:**

- **Data Sovereignty:** You own your data. Period.
- **Group Isolation:** Your group's data is completely isolated from other groups
- **Local-First Option:** Run ONE locally with 100% data ownership
- **Transparent Architecture:** Every data flow maps to our 6-dimension ontology
- **GDPR, CCPA, and PIPEDA Compliant:** Built with privacy-by-design principles

## 2. Ontology-Aligned Privacy Framework

### 2.1 Dimension 1: GROUPS (Multi-Tenant Isolation)

**What We Collect:**

- Group slug (URL identifier)
- Group name and type (friend_circle, business, community, dao, government, organization)
- Parent group relationships (for hierarchical structures)
- Group settings (visibility, join policy, plan level)
- Resource usage (users, storage, API calls)

**Legal Basis:**

- **Contract Performance:** Processing necessary to provide multi-tenant services
- **Legitimate Interest:** Group administration and resource management

**Data Controller:**

- **Platform-level groups:** ONE Platform (Anthony O'Connell) is the data controller
- **Customer groups:** Group owner is the data controller; ONE Platform is the data processor

**Isolation Guarantee:**
All data within a group (things, connections, events, knowledge) is isolated from other groups. Group owners control access to their group's data.

**Hierarchical Access:**
Parent groups CAN access child group data (configurable). This must be disclosed in your group settings if enabled.

### 2.2 Dimension 2: PEOPLE (Authorization & User Identity)

**What We Collect:**

- **Account Information:** Email address, username, display name
- **Authentication Data:** Password hash (bcrypt), session tokens, OAuth tokens (encrypted)

- **Authorization Records:** Group memberships, permissions

**Legal Basis:**

- **Contract Performance:** Account creation and authentication
- **Consent:** Profile information and preferences
- **Legal Obligation:** Identity verification (where required by law)

**Four Role Types & Privacy Implications:**
