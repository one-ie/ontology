# ONE Platform: Release Workflow v1.0.0

**Focus:** Release software correctly every time
**Process:** `/release [patch|minor|major]`
**Duration:** ~12-15 minutes per release
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-30

---

## RELEASE SEQUENCE: Steps 1-100

**Golden Rule:** Execute steps IN ORDER. Never skip validation.

---

## PHASE 1: PRE-RELEASE VALIDATION (Steps 1-10)

**Purpose:** Verify system is ready to release

### Step 1: Check Git Status
- [ ] Run: `git status --short`
- [ ] Expected: Clean or acceptable uncommitted changes only
- [ ] If dirty: Commit or stash changes
- [ ] Continue: ✓

### Step 2: Run All Tests
- [ ] Frontend: `cd web && bun test`
- [ ] Backend: `cd backend && npx convex dev` (verify no errors)
- [ ] Expected: All tests passing
- [ ] If failing: Fix tests before release
- [ ] Continue: ✓

### Step 3: Check Web Builds
- [ ] Run: `cd web && bun run build`
- [ ] Expected: Build succeeds with 0 errors
- [ ] Type check: `bunx astro check`
- [ ] If errors: Fix TypeScript errors
- [ ] Continue: ✓

### Step 4: Validate Environment
- [ ] Check root `.env` exists with:

## TROUBLESHOOTING QUICK REFERENCE

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Tests failing | Fix code, commit, restart release from Step 1 |
| Build errors | Run `bunx astro check`, fix TypeScript, retry build |
| npm auth fails | Run `npm login`, enter credentials |
| Cloudflare deploy fails | Check `CLOUDFLARE_GLOBAL_API_KEY` in `.env` |
| Version mismatch | Run release script again to sync all files |
| Files not synced | Check release script output, verify 518+ files |
| Site not live | Wait 2 minutes for DNS propagation, then test |
